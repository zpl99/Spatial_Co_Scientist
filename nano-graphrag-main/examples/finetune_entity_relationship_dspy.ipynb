    "# Evaluating Entity Relationship Extraction with DSPy & Fine-Tune Prompt Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "- Load DSPy examples (separated into train, val, dev) that are saved locally.\n",
    "- Evaluate the extraction module with the dev examples to determine the baseline scores, i.e: the fine-tuned extraction module should score higher.\n",
    "- Run bootstrapping with random search with train examples, evaluate its compiled extraction module on the same dev examples to compare against baseline scores.\n",
    "- Run MIPROv2 with train and dev examples, evaluate its compiled extraction module on the same dev examples to compare against baseline and bootstrapping with random search scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use MIPROv2?\n",
    "MIPROv2 is an optimizer that generates candidate few-shot examples and instructions for each prompt in the extraction module, and then optimizes over the fewshot examples and instructions as hyperparameters for a number of batches. For each batch, the optimizer evaluates different combinations of prompts on a subset of training inputs and learns the combinations that maximizes performance. This optimizer is quite useful when dealing with a large number of training examples. "

It uses a pipeline that involves a language model to perform this extraction. The program works by defining a signature that specifies the input fields (input_text and entity_types) and the output fields (reasoning and entities_relationships). The TypedPredictor class ensures that the type annotations in the signature are enforced, and it handles retries and error explanations if the output is invalid. The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor class integrates this predictor to extract entities and relationships from the input text, converting the results into a structured format. The program uses a combination of type checking, JSON schema validation, and language model predictions to achieve its task.\n"

It uses a pipeline that involves a language model to perform this extraction. The program works by defining a signature that specifies the input fields (input_text and entity_types) and the output fields (reasoning and entities_relationships). The TypedPredictor class ensures that the type annotations in the signature are enforced, and it handles retries and error explanations if the output is invalid. The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor class integrates this predictor to extract entities and relationships from the input text, converting the results into a structured format. The program uses a combination of type checking, JSON schema validation, and language model predictions to achieve its task.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of extracting entities and relationships from a given text input. It uses a pipeline that involves a language model to perform this extraction. The program works by defining a signature that specifies the input fields (input_text and entity_types) and the output fields (reasoning and entities_relationships). The TypedPredictor class ensures that the type annotations in the signature are enforced, and it handles retries and error explanations if the output is invalid. The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor class integrates this predictor to extract entities and relationships from the input text, converting the results into a structured format. The program uses a combination of type checking, JSON schema validation, and language model predictions to achieve its task.\n",

      "For Williams that would mean winning a record-tying 24th grand slam title, which has so far proved elusive despite getting close four times since returning to the tour after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia. Her preparation for the year's first major couldn't have gone much better, suggesting the mini grand slam drought for arguably tennis' greatest ever player is about to cease. Williams let rip into a punching bag in December -- drawing a compliment from former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, whose daughter happens to be a budding tennis star -- and then won a buildup tournament in Auckland last week to incredibly land a title in a fourth straight decade. She also mingled with one of tennis' youngest sensations, Coco Gauff, as part of the training camp in Florida organized by her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. JUST WATCHEDMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroe 02:19Read MoreWilliams overcame singles opponents with differing styles, reached the doubles final with one of her best friends -- the soon-to-be retired Caroline Wozniacki -- and most crucially, ended a five-match losing streak in finals with her daughter and husband Alexis Ohanian looking on.  No wonder the 38-year-old said following her straight-set victory over fellow American Jessica Pegula: \"It's pretty satisfying just to get a win in the final. That was really important for me. And I just want to build on it,\" added Williams, who donated her prize money check of $43,000 to bush fire relief efforts in Australia. \"It's just a step towards the next goal.\"Indeed.

The much bigger prize is the Australian Open, where Williams triumphed while in the early stages of pregnancy in 2017.  If Williams makes the final in Melbourne -- and she might have to defeat the likes of twice grand slam winner Naomi Osaka and current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty along the way -- she will probably have to then defeat someone with a heftier reputation than the 66th-ranked Pegula. Helping Williams, however, is that one of the main contenders, Bianca Andreescu, isn't in Melbourne because of another injury, this time to a knee. But winning any final -- after losses in grand slam finals to Osaka, Andreescu, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and retiring against Andreescu in the Rogers Cup finale last August -- could potentially be turning point as Williams attempts to draw level with the grand slam haul of Australia's Margaret Court. JUST WATCHEDSerena Williams falls short in major title chaseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSerena Williams falls short in major title chase 01:00\"Serena, she certainly looks hungry, and I think she's got a little momentum going into the Australian Open,\" Chris Evert, the 18-time grand slam champion, told reporters in an ESPN conference call last week. \"And it would probably be the least pressure, this grand slam, to win for her. \"I think every other tournament, the French Open, the clay isn't her best surface. Wimbledon is a lot of pressure, US Open is a lot of pressure. \"This one, the first one of the year, it's a 'Happy Slam,'\" referring to the Australian Open's nickname. \"I think if she just takes a little bit of pressure off herself and she can just play her brand of tennis, I think she's got a good shot at winning it.\"She's better at grand slams than any other player when you look at the last two years.\"The way Wozniacki put it, Williams has a \"big chance\" to match Court. pic.twitter.com/skoZilynH8— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 12, 2020 Other high-profile players, such as Halep and former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova -- who saved four match points last year in Melbourne against Williams and rallied from 5-1 down in the third set after the American rolled her ankle -- aren't discounting her chances, either, despite just falling short recently at grand slams. \"I'm very impressed about her, that she keeps playing at this level, with being a mother and also being a little bit older than us,\" said Halep, who made a mere three unforced errors in downing Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final. \"It's impressive what she does.\"Challenges aheadBut Evert also underscored the stiffer challenges facing Williams. \"There are some darned good players out there that I have a lot of respect for, and the way that Osaka, Barty, Pliskova, Halep ... there's not one or two threats to Serena, there's probably about eight threats, eight players that can probably do some damage and that can compete against her.\"And one more thing is -- I always felt this way -- the older you get, I think the more bad days you may have, days when you feel burned out, days when you don't want to get out of bed, days when you don't have incentive. You don't want to have that day during a grand slam, but sometimes you can't help it.\"JUST WATCHEDSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon titleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon title 01:56Visit our tennis page for more news and videosWilliams figures to still be around towards the end of the Australian Open, but whether it is as the last person standing continues to be the question. \n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Neymar surpassed Ronaldo and moved to second on Brazil's all-time goalscoring list with a hat-trick in a 4-2 win against Peru in World Cup qualifying.Two penalties and a last-minute tap-in took the Paris Saint-Germain forward's tally to 64 for his country, two ahead of Ronaldo and 13 behind Pele's all-time record of 77.Everton's Richarlison scored Brazil's other goal as the five-time world champion twice had to come from behind to secure the win.Brazil head coach Tite told reporters after the match that it was \"unfair\" to compare Neymar and Ronaldo.\"What I can say is Neymar has this unpredictability,\" he said. \"He is the bow and the arrow, he's a player who both makes and takes chances. And he gets better and better, and more mature.\"Read MoreNeymar celebrates after completing his hat-trick against Peru.The match had a number of controversial VAR moments, particularly the decision to award Neymar a second penalty late in the game with the score tied at 2-2, a decision which surprised even the Brazilian players.Peru's anger was compounded in stoppage time when Carlos Zambrano was shown a red card for an elbow on Richarlison. The Everton forward had escaped punishment for a similar incident earlier in the match that left Peru's Miguel Trauco with a bloody wound above his eye.The latest incidents added to a growing list of decisions that have left South American fans scratching their heads during this international break, the first time VAR has been used in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiersBrazil's victory ensures it begins the grueling 18-month campaign with a 100% record to top the standings on six points along with Argentina, which secured an impressive 2-1 win in the altitude of La Paz, Bolivia earlier in the day.The top four teams will qualify automatically for Qatar 2022, with the fifth-placed team competing in a two-legged playoff against a country from another continent.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)The New York City Marathon returns on Sunday following a two-year hiatus, and at the front of the field, legendary distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is primed to \"make more history\" in his storied career. Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men's elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that's why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it's also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge's world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year's Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge's record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night's sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It's a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn't sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I've recovered well ... At this moment, I'm really strong. I hope I'll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year's New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele's 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has 'the qualities of an ascetic monk'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya's Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance's two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city's five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It's more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women's race is headlined by Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA's Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAnother athlete to keep an eye on is US star Shalane Flanagan as she attempts to run six marathons in 42 days. Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he's grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year's cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"\n",

It works by first identifying entities in the text based on provided entity types, then determining the relationships between these entities considering their interactions and dependencies within the context of the text. Finally, it formats the entities and relationships according to a specified JSON schema. The program uses a pipeline that includes a language model to perform these tasks, ensuring type annotations and handling retries and errors in the extraction process.\n",

      "For Williams that would mean winning a record-tying 24th grand slam title, which has so far proved elusive despite getting close four times since returning to the tour after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia. Her preparation for the year's first major couldn't have gone much better, suggesting the mini grand slam drought for arguably tennis' greatest ever player is about to cease. Williams let rip into a punching bag in December -- drawing a compliment from former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, whose daughter happens to be a budding tennis star -- and then won a buildup tournament in Auckland last week to incredibly land a title in a fourth straight decade. She also mingled with one of tennis' youngest sensations, Coco Gauff, as part of the training camp in Florida organized by her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. JUST WATCHEDMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroe 02:19Read MoreWilliams overcame singles opponents with differing styles, reached the doubles final with one of her best friends -- the soon-to-be retired Caroline Wozniacki -- and most crucially, ended a five-match losing streak in finals with her daughter and husband Alexis Ohanian looking on.  No wonder the 38-year-old said following her straight-set victory over fellow American Jessica Pegula: \"It's pretty satisfying just to get a win in the final. That was really important for me. And I just want to build on it,\" added Williams, who donated her prize money check of $43,000 to bush fire relief efforts in Australia. \"It's just a step towards the next goal.\"Indeed. READ: Can Rafael Nadal match Roger Federer's all-time grand slam record?READ: Player brands Australian Open email a 'slap in the face'Eyes on bigger prizeYes, as nice as it was to be holding the winners' trophy in Auckland -- where Williams once hit 88 unforced errors in a loss to Madison Brengle -- she didn't make the long trip to simply prosper in New Zealand. The much bigger prize is the Australian Open, where Williams triumphed while in the early stages of pregnancy in 2017.  If Williams makes the final in Melbourne -- and she might have to defeat the likes of twice grand slam winner Naomi Osaka and current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty along the way -- she will probably have to then defeat someone with a heftier reputation than the 66th-ranked Pegula. Helping Williams, however, is that one of the main contenders, Bianca Andreescu, isn't in Melbourne because of another injury, this time to a knee. But winning any final -- after losses in grand slam finals to Osaka, Andreescu, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and retiring against Andreescu in the Rogers Cup finale last August -- could potentially be turning point as Williams attempts to draw level with the grand slam haul of Australia's Margaret Court.

Wimbledon is a lot of pressure, US Open is a lot of pressure. \"This one, the first one of the year, it's a 'Happy Slam,'\" referring to the Australian Open's nickname. \"I think if she just takes a little bit of pressure off herself and she can just play her brand of tennis, I think she's got a good shot at winning it.\"She's better at grand slams than any other player when you look at the last two years.\"The way Wozniacki put it, Williams has a \"big chance\" to match Court. pic.twitter.com/skoZilynH8— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 12, 2020 Other high-profile players, such as Halep and former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova -- who saved four match points last year in Melbourne against Williams and rallied from 5-1 down in the third set after the American rolled her ankle -- aren't discounting her chances, either, despite just falling short recently at grand slams. \"I'm very impressed about her, that she keeps playing at this level, with being a mother and also being a little bit older than us,\" said Halep, who made a mere three unforced errors in downing Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final. \"It's impressive what she does.\"Challenges aheadBut Evert also underscored the stiffer challenges facing Williams. \"There are some darned good players out there that I have a lot of respect for, and the way that Osaka, Barty, Pliskova, Halep ... there's not one or two threats to Serena, there's probably about eight threats, eight players that can probably do some damage and that can compete against her.\"And one more thing is -- I always felt this way -- the older you get, I think the more bad days you may have, days when you feel burned out, days when you don't want to get out of bed, days when you don't have incentive. You don't want to have that day during a grand slam, but sometimes you can't help it.\"JUST WATCHEDSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon titleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon title 01:56Visit our tennis page for more news and videosWilliams figures to still be around towards the end of the Australian Open, but whether it is as the last person standing continues to be the question. \n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Neymar surpassed Ronaldo and moved to second on Brazil's all-time goalscoring list with a hat-trick in a 4-2 win against Peru in World Cup qualifying.Two penalties and a last-minute tap-in took the Paris Saint-Germain forward's tally to 64 for his country, two ahead of Ronaldo and 13 behind Pele's all-time record of 77.Everton's Richarlison scored Brazil's other goal as the five-time world champion twice had to come from behind to secure the win.Brazil head coach Tite told reporters after the match that it was \"unfair\" to compare Neymar and Ronaldo.\"What I can say is Neymar has this unpredictability,\" he said. \"He is the bow and the arrow, he's a player who both makes and takes chances. And he gets better and better, and more mature.\"Read MoreNeymar celebrates after completing his hat-trick against Peru.The match had a number of controversial VAR moments, particularly the decision to award Neymar a second penalty late in the game with the score tied at 2-2, a decision which surprised even the Brazilian players.Peru's anger was compounded in stoppage time when Carlos Zambrano was shown a red card for an elbow on Richarlison. The Everton forward had escaped punishment for a similar incident earlier in the match that left Peru's Miguel Trauco with a bloody wound above his eye.The latest incidents added to a growing list of decisions that have left South American fans scratching their heads during this international break, the first time VAR has been used in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiersBrazil's victory ensures it begins the grueling 18-month campaign with a 100% record to top the standings on six points along with Argentina, which secured an impressive 2-1 win in the altitude of La Paz, Bolivia earlier in the day.The top four teams will qualify automatically for Qatar 2022, with the fifth-placed team competing in a two-legged playoff against a country from another continent.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)The New York City Marathon returns on Sunday following a two-year hiatus, and at the front of the field, legendary distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is primed to \"make more history\" in his storied career. Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men's elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that's why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it's also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge's world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year's Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge's record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night's sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It's a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn't sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I've recovered well ... At this moment, I'm really strong. I hope I'll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year's New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele's 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has 'the qualities of an ascetic monk'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya's Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance's two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city's five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It's more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women's race is headlined by Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA's Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAnother athlete to keep an eye on is US star Shalane Flanagan as she attempts to run six marathons in 42 days. Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he's grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year's cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"\n",

      "task_demos Input Text:  (CNN)Former Bosnian Serb army leader Ratko Mladic was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday after being found guilty of genocide for atrocities committed during the Bosnian war from 1992 to 1995.Verdict proceedings had been interrupted earlier when the 74-year-old's legal team claimed that his blood pressure was too high to continue.After outbursts from Mladic, Judge Alphons Orie, who was delivering a summation of the case, ordered the removal of the ex-general, telling him he could monitor proceedings by audio and video. \"I am very distraught,\" Mladic shouted inside the courtroom. \"Everything that you have said is pure lies. Shame on you. It's all lies.\"Mladic's legal team had asked for proceedings to be halted or for the summation of the case to be skipped, which the Judge refused. Read MoreMladic was charged with two counts of genocide and nine crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1995, during which 100,000 people were killed and another 2.2 million displaced. He was found not guilty on one charge of genocide, but received a guilty verdict on each of the other 10 counts. Mladic's lawyer, Dragan Ivetic, said it was \"certain\" Mladic would appeal.\"Butcher of Bosnia\" Ratko Mladic has been found guilty of the highest crimes against international law, says CNN's @camanpour, who covered the Bosnian war https://t.co/4A7DtVjHn8 pic.twitter.com/HdPKU3tqRD— CNN International (@cnni) November 22, 2017The trial, which opened in 2012, took place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands. The ad hoc court was established to prosecute crimes committed during the Balkans conflict.  Mladic was accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing, including the slaughter of thousands of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in July 1995. It is the worst massacre to have taken place in Europe since the Second World War.Mladic judgment brings back stench of Bosnian genocideProsecutor Serge Brammertz told reporters that Mladic will be remembered by history \"for the many communities and lives he destroyed.\"\"Today's judgment is a milestone in the tribunal's history and for international justice,\" he added.The trial of Mladic, who was arrested in 2011, has lasted 530 days and included more than 500 witnesses and nearly 10,000 exhibits. Before the case was adjourned last December, prosecutors recommended a life sentence. Mladic had previously referred to the court as \"satanic\" and labeled the charges against him as \"obnoxious.\"ReactionAt a center for the association of women victims of war in Sarajevo, there was an outpouring of emotion during the judge's summation.There was particular frustration that Mladic was acquitted on one charge of genocide in Bosnian municipalities outside of Srebrenica.Amela Meduseljac (L) and Meliha Mrdzic were unhappy that Mladic was acquitted on one charge.Meliha Mrdzic, who said her father and brother were killed and thrown into the Drina River in Visegrad, told CNN she was left humiliated by the decision.\"The international community made me a victim a second time,\" she said. \"They make it seem like we killed ourselves, raped ourselves, slaughtered ourselves. I feel so hurt, I can't describe it.\"Amela Meduseljac, who said she was raped by Mladic's soldiers at Visegrad, said that victims will struggle to get over the judgment.\"Our mission as a rape survivor association was to stop victims from feeling like victims,\" she said. \"But it's getting worse from year to year and it will get especially worse after this verdict.\"People in Srebrenica celebrate as they watch a live TV broadcast of the trial Wednesday.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called Mladic the \"epitome of evil\" and labeled his conviction a \"momentous victory for justice.\"  \"Mladic presided over some of the darkest crimes to occur in Europe since World War II, bringing terror, death and destruction to thousands of victims, and sorrow, tragedy and trauma to countless more,\" Zeid said in a statement.\"His conviction is a testament to the courage and determination of those victims and witnesses who never gave up hope that they would see him brought to justice.\"A woman writes in a book inside a traveling monument called \"Prijedor 92\" outside the tribunal in The Hague on Wednesday.In Serbia, the country's president, Aleksandar Vučić, urged his people to look forward to the future.\"Today is not a day for joy, nor for sorrow, but to see what kind of future we want,\" he told reporters. \"We all knew that the judgment would be like that. There is no one who did not know it in advance. My call to all citizens of Serbia is to start looking at the future today. \"Let's think about where and how our children will live. How and in what way will we preserve peace and stability in the region\"In a separate development, Serbia's Minister for Justice Nela Kuburović urged that Mladic be released to undergo medical treatment.Who is Ratko Mladic?The ex-general -- accused of being \"the Butcher of Bosnia\" -- was in command of the Bosnian Serb army that entered the town of Srebrenica in July 1995. In the days that followed, 8,000 Muslim men and boys were systematically slaughtered by troops under his leadership.JUST WATCHEDAmanpour meets the 'Butcher of Bosnia'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanpour meets the 'Butcher of Bosnia' 04:05The late Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as \"one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer.\"Read: Bosnia's future is tied to justiceMladic faced charges over his actions during the siege of Sarajevo, where his heavily armed forces cut the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city from higher ground each day, trapping Sarajevo's residents in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished.JUST WATCHEDMarking 20 years since Srebrenica: A survivor's storyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMarking 20 years since Srebrenica: A survivor's story 04:26After the war ended in 1995, Mladic went on the run before being found 16 years later when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia.Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands.Srebrenica massacre: Two decades on, wounds still raw, graves still openIn 2011, a tribunal judge entered pleas of not guilty for Mladic after he refused to cooperate and was forcibly removed from the courtroom at the judge's order.Mladic's judgment day comes more than a year after Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the 1990s conflict. Former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed.At a news conference following the verdict, Mladic's son Darko said that his father felt sorry for every victim of the conflict. \"General Mladic cannot accept responsibility for things he did not do,\" Darko Mladic said. He argued that what had happened in Srebrenica was \"legitimate.\"Melina Borcak and Lindsay Isaac in Sarajevo contributed to this report.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Neymar surpassed Ronaldo and moved to second on Brazil's all-time goalscoring list with a hat-trick in a 4-2 win against Peru in World Cup qualifying.Two penalties and a last-minute tap-in took the Paris Saint-Germain forward's tally to 64 for his country, two ahead of Ronaldo and 13 behind Pele's all-time record of 77.Everton's Richarlison scored Brazil's other goal as the five-time world champion twice had to come from behind to secure the win.Brazil head coach Tite told reporters after the match that it was \"unfair\" to compare Neymar and Ronaldo.\"What I can say is Neymar has this unpredictability,\" he said. \"He is the bow and the arrow, he's a player who both makes and takes chances. And he gets better and better, and more mature.\"Read MoreNeymar celebrates after completing his hat-trick against Peru.The match had a number of controversial VAR moments, particularly the decision to award Neymar a second penalty late in the game with the score tied at 2-2, a decision which surprised even the Brazilian players.Peru's anger was compounded in stoppage time when Carlos Zambrano was shown a red card for an elbow on Richarlison. The Everton forward had escaped punishment for a similar incident earlier in the match that left Peru's Miguel Trauco with a bloody wound above his eye.The latest incidents added to a growing list of decisions that have left South American fans scratching their heads during this international break, the first time VAR has been used in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiersBrazil's victory ensures it begins the grueling 18-month campaign with a 100% record to top the standings on six points along with Argentina, which secured an impressive 2-1 win in the altitude of La Paz, Bolivia earlier in the day.The top four teams will qualify automatically for Qatar 2022, with the fifth-placed team competing in a two-legged playoff against a country from another continent.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Former Bosnian Serb army leader Ratko Mladic was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday after being found guilty of genocide for atrocities committed during the Bosnian war from 1992 to 1995.Verdict proceedings had been interrupted earlier when the 74-year-old's legal team claimed that his blood pressure was too high to continue.After outbursts from Mladic, Judge Alphons Orie, who was delivering a summation of the case, ordered the removal of the ex-general, telling him he could monitor proceedings by audio and video. \"I am very distraught,\" Mladic shouted inside the courtroom. \"Everything that you have said is pure lies. Shame on you. It's all lies.\"Mladic's legal team had asked for proceedings to be halted or for the summation of the case to be skipped, which the Judge refused. Read MoreMladic was charged with two counts of genocide and nine crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1995, during which 100,000 people were killed and another 2.2 million displaced. He was found not guilty on one charge of genocide, but received a guilty verdict on each of the other 10 counts. Mladic's lawyer, Dragan Ivetic, said it was \"certain\" Mladic would appeal.\"Butcher of Bosnia\" Ratko Mladic has been found guilty of the highest crimes against international law, says CNN's @camanpour, who covered the Bosnian war https://t.co/4A7DtVjHn8 pic.twitter.com/HdPKU3tqRD— CNN International (@cnni) November 22, 2017The trial, which opened in 2012, took place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands. The ad hoc court was established to prosecute crimes committed during the Balkans conflict.  Mladic was accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing, including the slaughter of thousands of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in July 1995. It is the worst massacre to have taken place in Europe since the Second World War.Mladic judgment brings back stench of Bosnian genocideProsecutor Serge Brammertz told reporters that Mladic will be remembered by history \"for the many communities and lives he destroyed.\"\"Today's judgment is a milestone in the tribunal's history and for international justice,\" he added.The trial of Mladic, who was arrested in 2011, has lasted 530 days and included more than 500 witnesses and nearly 10,000 exhibits. Before the case was adjourned last December, prosecutors recommended a life sentence. Mladic had previously referred to the court as \"satanic\" and labeled the charges against him as \"obnoxious.\"ReactionAt a center for the association of women victims of war in Sarajevo, there was an outpouring of emotion during the judge's summation.There was particular frustration that Mladic was acquitted on one charge of genocide in Bosnian municipalities outside of Srebrenica.Amela Meduseljac (L) and Meliha Mrdzic were unhappy that Mladic was acquitted on one charge.Meliha Mrdzic, who said her father and brother were killed and thrown into the Drina River in Visegrad, told CNN she was left humiliated by the decision.\"The international community made me a victim a second time,\" she said. \"They make it seem like we killed ourselves, raped ourselves, slaughtered ourselves. I feel so hurt, I can't describe it.\"Amela Meduseljac, who said she was raped by Mladic's soldiers at Visegrad, said that victims will struggle to get over the judgment.\"Our mission as a rape survivor association was to stop victims from feeling like victims,\" she said. \"But it's getting worse from year to year and it will get especially worse after this verdict.\"People in Srebrenica celebrate as they watch a live TV broadcast of the trial Wednesday.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called Mladic the \"epitome of evil\" and labeled his conviction a \"momentous victory for justice.\"  \"Mladic presided over some of the darkest crimes to occur in Europe since World War II, bringing terror, death and destruction to thousands of victims, and sorrow, tragedy and trauma to countless more,\" Zeid said in a statement.\"His conviction is a testament to the courage and determination of those victims and witnesses who never gave up hope that they would see him brought to justice.\"A woman writes in a book inside a traveling monument called \"Prijedor 92\" outside the tribunal in The Hague on Wednesday.In Serbia, the country's president, Aleksandar Vučić, urged his people to look forward to the future.\"Today is not a day for joy, nor for sorrow, but to see what kind of future we want,\" he told reporters. \"We all knew that the judgment would be like that. There is no one who did not know it in advance. My call to all citizens of Serbia is to start looking at the future today. \"Let's think about where and how our children will live. How and in what way will we preserve peace and stability in the region\"In a separate development, Serbia's Minister for Justice Nela Kuburović urged that Mladic be released to undergo medical treatment.Who is Ratko Mladic?The ex-general -- accused of being \"the Butcher of Bosnia\" -- was in command of the Bosnian Serb army that entered the town of Srebrenica in July 1995. In the days that followed, 8,000 Muslim men and boys were systematically slaughtered by troops under his leadership.JUST WATCHEDAmanpour meets the 'Butcher of Bosnia'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanpour meets the 'Butcher of Bosnia' 04:05The late Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as \"one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer.\"Read: Bosnia's future is tied to justiceMladic faced charges over his actions during the siege of Sarajevo, where his heavily armed forces cut the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city from higher ground each day, trapping Sarajevo's residents in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished.JUST WATCHEDMarking 20 years since Srebrenica: A survivor's storyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMarking 20 years since Srebrenica: A survivor's story 04:26After the war ended in 1995, Mladic went on the run before being found 16 years later when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia.Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands.Srebrenica massacre: Two decades on, wounds still raw, graves still openIn 2011, a tribunal judge entered pleas of not guilty for Mladic after he refused to cooperate and was forcibly removed from the courtroom at the judge's order.Mladic's judgment day comes more than a year after Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the 1990s conflict. Former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed.At a news conference following the verdict, Mladic's son Darko said that his father felt sorry for every victim of the conflict. \"General Mladic cannot accept responsibility for things he did not do,\" Darko Mladic said. He argued that what had happened in Srebrenica was \"legitimate.\"Melina Borcak and Lindsay Isaac in Sarajevo contributed to this report.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Neymar surpassed Ronaldo and moved to second on Brazil's all-time goalscoring list with a hat-trick in a 4-2 win against Peru in World Cup qualifying.Two penalties and a last-minute tap-in took the Paris Saint-Germain forward's tally to 64 for his country, two ahead of Ronaldo and 13 behind Pele's all-time record of 77.Everton's Richarlison scored Brazil's other goal as the five-time world champion twice had to come from behind to secure the win.Brazil head coach Tite told reporters after the match that it was \"unfair\" to compare Neymar and Ronaldo.\"What I can say is Neymar has this unpredictability,\" he said. \"He is the bow and the arrow, he's a player who both makes and takes chances. And he gets better and better, and more mature.\"Read MoreNeymar celebrates after completing his hat-trick against Peru.The match had a number of controversial VAR moments, particularly the decision to award Neymar a second penalty late in the game with the score tied at 2-2, a decision which surprised even the Brazilian players.Peru's anger was compounded in stoppage time when Carlos Zambrano was shown a red card for an elbow on Richarlison. The Everton forward had escaped punishment for a similar incident earlier in the match that left Peru's Miguel Trauco with a bloody wound above his eye.The latest incidents added to a growing list of decisions that have left South American fans scratching their heads during this international break, the first time VAR has been used in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiersBrazil's victory ensures it begins the grueling 18-month campaign with a 100% record to top the standings on six points along with Argentina, which secured an impressive 2-1 win in the altitude of La Paz, Bolivia earlier in the day.The top four teams will qualify automatically for Qatar 2022, with the fifth-placed team competing in a two-legged playoff against a country from another continent.\n",

      "task_demos Input Text:  (CNN)The New York City Marathon returns on Sunday following a two-year hiatus, and at the front of the field, legendary distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is primed to \"make more history\" in his storied career. Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men's elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that's why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it's also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge's world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year's Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge's record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night's sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It's a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn't sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I've recovered well ... At this moment, I'm really strong. I hope I'll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year's New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele's 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has 'the qualities of an ascetic monk'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya's Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance's two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city's five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It's more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women's race is headlined by Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA's Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAnother athlete to keep an eye on is US star Shalane Flanagan as she attempts to run six marathons in 42 days. Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he's grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year's cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of extracting entities and their relationships from a given text input. It works by first identifying entities in the text based on specified entity types. Then, it determines the relationships between these entities, considering their interactions and dependencies within the context of the text. Finally, it formats the entities and relationships according to a specified JSON schema. The program uses a language model to perform these tasks and includes mechanisms for error handling and retries to ensure accurate results.\n",

      "TASK DEMO(S):\n",
      "Input Text:  (CNN)The New York City Marathon returns on Sunday following a two-year hiatus, and at the front of the field, legendary distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is primed to \"make more history\" in his storied career. Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men's elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that's why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it's also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge's world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year's Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge's record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night's sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It's a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn't sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I've recovered well ... At this moment, I'm really strong. I hope I'll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year's New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele's 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has 'the qualities of an ascetic monk'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya's Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance's two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city's five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It's more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women's race is headlined by Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA's Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAnother athlete to keep an eye on is US star Shalane Flanagan as she attempts to run six marathons in 42 days. Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he's grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year's cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of extracting entities and their relationships from a given text. It uses a language model to identify entities based on specified types and then determines the relationships between these entities. The program works by first defining a signature that includes input fields for the text and entity types, and output fields for reasoning and the extracted entities and relationships. It then uses a TypedPredictor to enforce type annotations and handle potential errors, ensuring that the output matches the expected format. The program iteratively attempts to extract and validate the entities and relationships, providing explanations for errors and suggesting corrections if necessary. Finally, it returns the extracted entities and their relationships in a structured format.\n"

      "task_demos Input Text:  (CNN)Roger Federer thinks the professional tennis circuit won't return for a while due to the coronavirus pandemic but, when the time does come, the Swiss superstar said he would find it difficult to play without fans. While European football's Bundesliga resurfaced last week behind closed doors and Spain's La Liga is set to resume the middle of next month, the last official word from tennis authorities essentially saw all action suspended through July. The hiatus began in March, with Federer already sidelined since he was recuperating from knee surgery. Sunday would have marked the first day of the French Open in its usual spot on the tennis calendar -- in March, though, it was rescheduled for September -- and another grand slam, Wimbledon in July, was called off. \"I'm not training at the moment because I don't see a reason for that to be honest,\" Federer told three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten -- who is raising funds for coronavirus relief efforts in his native Brazil -- in a video interview reported by Tennis.com.Read More\"I am happy with my body now and I still believe that the return of the tour is a long way off,\" continued the 38-year-old. \"And I think it's important mentally to enjoy this break, having played so much tennis. \"When I'm getting towards returning and have a goal to train for, I think I will be super motivated.\"We should be sliding into @rolandgarros right now, thinking of our mates in Paris 👋 pic.twitter.com/0PLKryyIjj— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) May 24, 2020 Federer is arguably tennis' best supported player ever, and the prospect of competing without spectators doesn't appeal to him. \"Most of the time when we are training, there is no one,\" said the men's record 20-time grand slam champion. \"For us, of course, it is possible to play if there are no fans. But on the other hand, I really hope that the circuit can return as it normally is. \"And hold off till the time is appropriate, minimum a third of the stadium or half full. But, for me, completely empty when playing big tournaments is very difficult.\"Federer has been active on social media during the lockdown, sparking a public discussion on the merging of the men's and women's tours with a tweet last month and embarking on a funny Instagram Live with tennis rival Rafael Nadal.Nadal, unlike Federer, has started practicing, though only very recently. The Spaniard would have been favored to win a 20th major and tie Federer had the French Open been played as usual given he has collected a record 12 titles at Roland Garros. Here I am, the first pictures I am posting for you on court. This is my practice earlier today at @rnadalacademy #BackOnCourt #BabolatFamily 🎾👍🏻💪🏻😉 pic.twitter.com/x7tzgLj9pc— Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) May 22, 2020 The next grand slam is scheduled to be late August's US Open in New York, with organizers expected to announce in June if it will go ahead.  \n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of extracting entities and their relationships from a given text. It uses a language model to identify entities based on specified types and then determines the relationships between these entities. The program works by first defining a signature that includes input fields for the text and entity types, and output fields for reasoning and the extracted entities and relationships. It then uses a TypedPredictor to enforce type annotations and handle potential errors, ensuring that the output matches the expected format. The program iteratively attempts to extract and validate the entities and relationships, providing explanations for errors and suggesting corrections if necessary. Finally, it returns the extracted entities and their relationships in a structured format.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Roger Federer thinks the professional tennis circuit won't return for a while due to the coronavirus pandemic but, when the time does come, the Swiss superstar said he would find it difficult to play without fans. While European football's Bundesliga resurfaced last week behind closed doors and Spain's La Liga is set to resume the middle of next month, the last official word from tennis authorities essentially saw all action suspended through July. The hiatus began in March, with Federer already sidelined since he was recuperating from knee surgery. Sunday would have marked the first day of the French Open in its usual spot on the tennis calendar -- in March, though, it was rescheduled for September -- and another grand slam, Wimbledon in July, was called off. \"I'm not training at the moment because I don't see a reason for that to be honest,\" Federer told three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten -- who is raising funds for coronavirus relief efforts in his native Brazil -- in a video interview reported by Tennis.com.Read More\"I am happy with my body now and I still believe that the return of the tour is a long way off,\" continued the 38-year-old. \"And I think it's important mentally to enjoy this break, having played so much tennis. \"When I'm getting towards returning and have a goal to train for, I think I will be super motivated.\"We should be sliding into @rolandgarros right now, thinking of our mates in Paris 👋 pic.twitter.com/0PLKryyIjj— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) May 24, 2020 Federer is arguably tennis' best supported player ever, and the prospect of competing without spectators doesn't appeal to him. \"Most of the time when we are training, there is no one,\" said the men's record 20-time grand slam champion. \"For us, of course, it is possible to play if there are no fans. But on the other hand, I really hope that the circuit can return as it normally is. \"And hold off till the time is appropriate, minimum a third of the stadium or half full. But, for me, completely empty when playing big tournaments is very difficult.\"Federer has been active on social media during the lockdown, sparking a public discussion on the merging of the men's and women's tours with a tweet last month and embarking on a funny Instagram Live with tennis rival Rafael Nadal.Nadal, unlike Federer, has started practicing, though only very recently. The Spaniard would have been favored to win a 20th major and tie Federer had the French Open been played as usual given he has collected a record 12 titles at Roland Garros. Here I am, the first pictures I am posting for you on court. This is my practice earlier today at @rnadalacademy #BackOnCourt #BabolatFamily 🎾👍🏻💪🏻😉 pic.twitter.com/x7tzgLj9pc— Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) May 22, 2020 The next grand slam is scheduled to be late August's US Open in New York, with organizers expected to announce in June if it will go ahead.  \n",

      "task_demos Input Text: Story highlightsThe Man v Fat soccer league is exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or moreThe league helps players lose weight, but it also gives them a built-in support group (CNN)After reviewing restaurants for years, Andrew Shanahan became obese and was looking for a way to lose weight.But it wasn't easy to find a program tailored to men. Every time he tried joining a weight-loss group, he was the only man in the room. \"I wondered how many other men felt that there was something missing and who weren't getting the support that you desperately need when you're trying to lose weight,\" he said.So in 2014, with the help of a crowdfunding campaign, Shanahan launched his Man v Fat initiative to reach out to other men like him. The idea drew attention from celebrities such as chef Jamie Oliver, and Shanahan was encouraged to write a book on it the next year. Being based in England, a soccer league seemed like a natural outreach program. And Shanahan received nearly 1,000 applications for 80 spots in the inaugural league, which was created exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or more.Read MorePhotographer Simone PerolariMany of the men used to play soccer -- or as it's called in most of the world, football -- but their weight had become an obstacle in pursuing the sport they love.\"I saw people who want to have fun and slim down and believe in what they do,\" said Simone Perolari, who photographed the league and whose images can be seen in the gallery above. \"There is not a space for them in classic football, but some of them are really good players.\"Rob Bird, 40, read about the league in the Birmingham Mail. He played the sport until he was 25, and he calls the 15 years after that the \"fat years\" when he didn't feel comfortable playing. \"I've always loved football, but playing against 'normal-size' guys left me feeling like I couldn't compete as they were faster,\" Bird said. \"(This league) is a level playing field for bigger guys.\" Shanahan isn't sure what he was expecting to result from the league's first season, but the competitiveness of the players surprised him. \"For a long time they haven't had a level playing field to compete on, so they are all determined to give it everything they have,\" he said. \"Fortunately, even those teams who lose can see that the benefits of losing weight and getting healthy more than make up for not topping the league.\"Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Shanahan watched bonds form between the men as they enjoyed their favorite sport and supported one another in their goals to get fit and healthy. After 14 weeks, the 80 team members collectively lost 1,727 pounds, with the average weight loss close to 22 pounds per player. Marcus Farnsworth lost more than 70 pounds and is enjoying the energy boost he's received in return. He hopes it will help with his knees and back as he continues to lose weight. But he also enjoyed the togetherness and support of the guys around him. \"It gives you good motivation if one person is feeling hungry or thinking about snacking,\" Farnsworth said. \"We can give advice and communicate through our WhatsApp group for support.\"Bird has dropped nearly 60 pounds and is now down to 210. His gout and leg ulcer have improved \"immeasurably.\"Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.Rob Bird, a player in the Man v Fat soccer league\"I feel a million times better,\" Bird said. \"This has given me the confidence that if you are making the right choices, you will feel better for it. Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.\"Shanahan is expanding the league across the rest of the United Kingdom beginning in July, and he hopes to start similar leagues in the United States and other countries. \"We saw a lot of health improvements, whether it was guys curing their sleep apnea, reversing their diabetes or lowering their blood pressure,\" Shanahan said. \"The other really notable thing was how much many of the players grew in confidence. \"I think it's a great thing to undertake a project with other people who desperately want the same thing. It gives you energy and impetus. Working with the guys has been one of the greatest privileges of my career. To share in their excitement and to witness their achievements has been amazing.\"Simone Perolari is an Italian photographer based in Paris. You can follow him on Facebook and Instagram.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of entity and relationship extraction from a given text. It works by taking an input text and a list of entity types, then using a language model to identify entities within the text that match the provided types. After identifying the entities, the program determines the relationships between these entities based on their interactions and dependencies within the context of the text. The process involves generating reasoning steps to justify the extraction, and the final output is a list of entities with their types, descriptions, and importance scores, along with relationships between these entities, including descriptions, weights, and order. The program ensures type safety and validation through the use of Pydantic models and retries the extraction process up to a specified number of times if errors are encountered.\n",

      "Input Text: Story highlightsThe Man v Fat soccer league is exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or moreThe league helps players lose weight, but it also gives them a built-in support group (CNN)After reviewing restaurants for years, Andrew Shanahan became obese and was looking for a way to lose weight.But it wasn't easy to find a program tailored to men. Every time he tried joining a weight-loss group, he was the only man in the room. \"I wondered how many other men felt that there was something missing and who weren't getting the support that you desperately need when you're trying to lose weight,\" he said.So in 2014, with the help of a crowdfunding campaign, Shanahan launched his Man v Fat initiative to reach out to other men like him. The idea drew attention from celebrities such as chef Jamie Oliver, and Shanahan was encouraged to write a book on it the next year. Being based in England, a soccer league seemed like a natural outreach program. And Shanahan received nearly 1,000 applications for 80 spots in the inaugural league, which was created exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or more.Read MorePhotographer Simone PerolariMany of the men used to play soccer -- or as it's called in most of the world, football -- but their weight had become an obstacle in pursuing the sport they love.\"I saw people who want to have fun and slim down and believe in what they do,\" said Simone Perolari, who photographed the league and whose images can be seen in the gallery above. \"There is not a space for them in classic football, but some of them are really good players.\"Rob Bird, 40, read about the league in the Birmingham Mail. He played the sport until he was 25, and he calls the 15 years after that the \"fat years\" when he didn't feel comfortable playing. \"I've always loved football, but playing against 'normal-size' guys left me feeling like I couldn't compete as they were faster,\" Bird said. \"(This league) is a level playing field for bigger guys.\" Shanahan isn't sure what he was expecting to result from the league's first season, but the competitiveness of the players surprised him. \"For a long time they haven't had a level playing field to compete on, so they are all determined to give it everything they have,\" he said. \"Fortunately, even those teams who lose can see that the benefits of losing weight and getting healthy more than make up for not topping the league.\"Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Shanahan watched bonds form between the men as they enjoyed their favorite sport and supported one another in their goals to get fit and healthy. After 14 weeks, the 80 team members collectively lost 1,727 pounds, with the average weight loss close to 22 pounds per player. Marcus Farnsworth lost more than 70 pounds and is enjoying the energy boost he's received in return. He hopes it will help with his knees and back as he continues to lose weight. But he also enjoyed the togetherness and support of the guys around him. \"It gives you good motivation if one person is feeling hungry or thinking about snacking,\" Farnsworth said. \"We can give advice and communicate through our WhatsApp group for support.\"Bird has dropped nearly 60 pounds and is now down to 210. His gout and leg ulcer have improved \"immeasurably.\"Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.Rob Bird, a player in the Man v Fat soccer league\"I feel a million times better,\" Bird said. \"This has given me the confidence that if you are making the right choices, you will feel better for it. Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.\"Shanahan is expanding the league across the rest of the United Kingdom beginning in July, and he hopes to start similar leagues in the United States and other countries. \"We saw a lot of health improvements, whether it was guys curing their sleep apnea, reversing their diabetes or lowering their blood pressure,\" Shanahan said. \"The other really notable thing was how much many of the players grew in confidence. \"I think it's a great thing to undertake a project with other people who desperately want the same thing. It gives you energy and impetus. Working with the guys has been one of the greatest privileges of my career. To share in their excitement and to witness their achievements has been amazing.\"Simone Perolari is an Italian photographer based in Paris. You can follow him on Facebook and Instagram.\n",

He is comfortable and responding to treatment but is not expected to leave hospital for several days,\" the palace said in a statement.Prince Philip was taken to the hospital last Tuesday after \"feeling unwell,\" Buckingham Palace said.On Monday, his grandson, Prince William, said the 99-year-old was doing \"OK\" and hospital staff were \"keeping an eye on him.\"Queen Elizabeth and Duke of Edinburgh receive Covid-19 vaccinePrince William made the remarks during a visit to a vaccination center in Norfolk, England, on Monday.Read MoreOn Tuesday, Prince Philip's youngest son, Prince Edward, told the UK's Sky News that he recently spoke to his father, who is doing \"a lot better\" and is looking forward to returning home.Prince Edward said the family was still keeping their \"fingers crossed\" for his father.\"We've had some brilliant and lovely messages from all sorts of people. And we really appreciate that and so does he. I've been passing them on,\" said Prince Edward.Prince Philip, who turns 100 in June, stepped back from public life in 2017 and has been taken to the hospital several times in recent years. In December 2019, he received hospital treatment for a pre-existing condition.His latest admission was not an emergency, according to a royal source, who said he traveled to King Edward VII Hospital by car and walked in unaided. The source added that the illness was not Covid-19 related.Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth have both received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.The couple spent most of the past year at Windsor Castle, having moved away from Buckingham Palace during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in spring 2020.

It uses a language model to perform this task, ensuring that the output adheres to strict type annotations and JSON schemas. The program follows a structured approach: it first identifies entities in the text according to the provided entity types, then determines the relationships between these entities based on their interactions and dependencies within the context of the text, and finally formats the entities and relationships according to a predefined JSON schema. The program includes error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure the output meets the required specifications.\n",

He is comfortable and responding to treatment but is not expected to leave hospital for several days,\" the palace said in a statement.Prince Philip was taken to the hospital last Tuesday after \"feeling unwell,\" Buckingham Palace said.On Monday, his grandson, Prince William, said the 99-year-old was doing \"OK\" and hospital staff were \"keeping an eye on him.\"Queen Elizabeth and Duke of Edinburgh receive Covid-19 vaccinePrince William made the remarks during a visit to a vaccination center in Norfolk, England, on Monday.Read MoreOn Tuesday, Prince Philip's youngest son, Prince Edward, told the UK's Sky News that he recently spoke to his father, who is doing \"a lot better\" and is looking forward to returning home.Prince Edward said the family was still keeping their \"fingers crossed\" for his father.\"We've had some brilliant and lovely messages from all sorts of people. And we really appreciate that and so does he. I've been passing them on,\" said Prince Edward.Prince Philip, who turns 100 in June, stepped back from public life in 2017 and has been taken to the hospital several times in recent years. In December 2019, he received hospital treatment for a pre-existing condition.His latest admission was not an emergency, according to a royal source, who said he traveled to King Edward VII Hospital by car and walked in unaided. The source added that the illness was not Covid-19 related.Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth have both received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.The couple spent most of the past year at Windsor Castle, having moved away from Buckingham Palace during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in spring 2020.

It works by first defining a signature that specifies the input fields (input_text and entity_types) and the output fields (reasoning and entities_relationships).

The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor class further processes the input text to extract entities and relationships, ensuring that the output is formatted according to the specified JSON schema. The program handles retries and errors by providing detailed explanations and examples to guide the language model in producing the correct output format.\n"

      "task_demos Input Text:  (CNN)This weekend either Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen will be crowned the Formula One world champion. Either way, the sport won big in 2021. This year's success starts with a boom in the sport's fanbase that can be pinned to Netflix's \"Drive to Survive\" docuseries. The show is a crash course on the 10 teams, the 20 drivers, the rivalries between them and the race competition structure. A word-of-mouth campaign for the series along with short, easy viewing episodes made it a perfect pandemic-time binge watch for millions around the world.The series' intimate interviews combined with the best action from races and the high level drama is a strong pitch for the real-life spectacle of Formula One.The multifaceted storytelling lets fans focus on the aspects of the sport that most appeal to them. And most importantly, \"Drive to Survive\" primed fans for an easy transition to the track when the 2021 season started.Read MoreThe popularity of the Netflix program, notably in the US, has paid dividends. ESPN says its race viewership in 2021 is up 56% over 2020. There was record attendance at the US Grand Prix in Austin this October -- drivers also credit the docuseries for the sport's growth, including Hamilton himself. READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year's constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen's car perched on top of Hamilton's after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton's brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen's car ended up on top of Hamilton's at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league's first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport. \n",

      "Input Text: Zurich Switzerland has chosen Lockheed Martin's F-35A Lightning II as its next-generation fighter jet, the government said on Wednesday, angering opponents who have pledged a new referendum to overturn what they dubbed an unnecessary \"Ferrari\" option.The $5.5 billion deal adds a 15th nation to the world's largest weapons project -- a family of interconnected, single-engine jets to be used by the United States and its allies and partners.It came alongside a $2.1 billion agreement to buy the Patriot surface-to-air missile system from US group Raytheon, with European competitors losing out on both deals.The F-35 has faced multiple budget overruns, delays and technical setbacks, but is building export momentum. Critics say the project, valued at trillions of dollars over its lifetime, has seen costs soar while failing to meet goals on capability.Neutral Switzerland will buy 36 F-35As after an evaluation found it had \"the highest overall benefit at the lowest overall cost,\" the government said.Read MoreBiden admin intends to move forward with $23B UAE weapons salesThe aircraft beat bids from Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, the Rafale from France's Dassault and the four-nation Eurofighter built by Germany- and Spain-backed Airbus, Italy's Leonardo and Britain's BAE Systems.The decision drew immediate criticism from anti-armaments campaigners and left-wing parties who will now launch a campaign for a referendum on the issue, the third Swiss vote on buying fighter jets.Voters seven years ago rejected the purchase of Gripen jets from Sweden's Saab, while the 6 billion Swiss franc ($6.5 billion) funding, which led to the decision to buy the F-35As, was only narrowly approved last year.Opponents say Switzerland doesn't need cutting-edge warplanes to defend its Alpine territory, which a supersonic jet can cross in 10 minutes.US warplanes fly first combat missions off foreign aircraft carrier since World War II\"The decision is simply incomprehensible,\" said Priska Seiler Graf, a member of Parliament for the left-leaning Social Democrats (SP), who has raised concerns about the cost.\"It's not just about buying them, but the upkeep and operating costs,\" she added. \"We should seek a European solution ... we don't want to be dependent on the United States.\"The government picked the Patriot missile system over Franco-Italian group Eurosam.Defense Minister Viola Amherd said the F-35As were chosen after being the most impressive performer in an evaluation and offered best value for money.Total costs of 15.5 billion francs ($16.7 billion) came in 2 billion francs cheaper than the next lowest bidder, the government said, based on buying and operating the aircraft over 30 years.\"We would not have bought a Ferrari if a VW would do and the Ferrari would be three times more expensive,\" Amherd told a news conference.The Swiss Parliament now has to approve the funding for the purchase, with the debate scheduled for early next year. It can debate costs and terms but not revisit the model selection.Dozens of US Air Force F-35 fighters taxi on the runway in preparation for a combat power exercise on Nov. 19, 2018, at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The fighter decision was closely watched as the first of three face-offs ahead of Finland and Canada.Lockheed's stealthy fifth-generation fighter recently added Poland to its list of European customers which includes Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Britain.US President Joe Biden had lobbied for American companies when meeting his Swiss counterpart while in Geneva for his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month.JUST WATCHEDWatch US F-35 jet fighters arrive in Europe (2017)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch US F-35 jet fighters arrive in Europe (2017) 00:55Analysts said the decision to snub both the European fighter jet candidates and surface-to-air missile offering could be seen as a Swiss rebuff to the European Union in a time of strained relations between Bern and Brussels after the collapse of talks over a new agreement governing trade and other matters.By doubling down on US suppliers the government could antagonize the 49.8% of voters who opposed funding last year.South Korea rolls out the KF-21, joining elite group of global supersonic fighter jet makersAnti-arms campaigners say Switzerland, which last fought a foreign war more than 200 years ago and has no discernable enemies, does not need cutting-edge fighters.But supporters have said Switzerland needs to be able to protect itself without relying on others.Jonas Kampus, political secretary of the Group for a Switzerland without an Army, said he was confident of winning a referendum against the F-35As.The government \"can expect a heavy defeat in the vote. The follow-up polls in September (2020) showed a clear rejection of the F-35 among the voting population,\" he said.Marionna Schlatter, a lawmaker with the Greens Party said the September poll was too close to ignore opposition concerns.\"The people don't want a Ferrari in the air,\" she said.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of entity and relationship extraction from text. It works by first defining a signature that specifies the input fields (input_text and entity_types) and the output fields (reasoning and entities_relationships). The program then uses a TypedPredictor class to enforce type annotations in the signature and handle retries and error explanations if the output is invalid. The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor class further processes the input text to extract entities and relationships, ensuring that the output is formatted according to the specified JSON schema. The program handles retries and errors by providing detailed explanations and examples to guide the language model in producing the correct output format.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)This weekend either Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen will be crowned the Formula One world champion. Either way, the sport won big in 2021. This year's success starts with a boom in the sport's fanbase that can be pinned to Netflix's \"Drive to Survive\" docuseries. The show is a crash course on the 10 teams, the 20 drivers, the rivalries between them and the race competition structure. A word-of-mouth campaign for the series along with short, easy viewing episodes made it a perfect pandemic-time binge watch for millions around the world.The series' intimate interviews combined with the best action from races and the high level drama is a strong pitch for the real-life spectacle of Formula One.The multifaceted storytelling lets fans focus on the aspects of the sport that most appeal to them. And most importantly, \"Drive to Survive\" primed fans for an easy transition to the track when the 2021 season started.Read MoreThe popularity of the Netflix program, notably in the US, has paid dividends. ESPN says its race viewership in 2021 is up 56% over 2020. There was record attendance at the US Grand Prix in Austin this October -- drivers also credit the docuseries for the sport's growth, including Hamilton himself. READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year's constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen's car perched on top of Hamilton's after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton's brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen's car ended up on top of Hamilton's at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league's first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport. \n",

      "Input Text: Zurich Switzerland has chosen Lockheed Martin's F-35A Lightning II as its next-generation fighter jet, the government said on Wednesday, angering opponents who have pledged a new referendum to overturn what they dubbed an unnecessary \"Ferrari\" option.The $5.5 billion deal adds a 15th nation to the world's largest weapons project -- a family of interconnected, single-engine jets to be used by the United States and its allies and partners.It came alongside a $2.1 billion agreement to buy the Patriot surface-to-air missile system from US group Raytheon, with European competitors losing out on both deals.The F-35 has faced multiple budget overruns, delays and technical setbacks, but is building export momentum. Critics say the project, valued at trillions of dollars over its lifetime, has seen costs soar while failing to meet goals on capability.Neutral Switzerland will buy 36 F-35As after an evaluation found it had \"the highest overall benefit at the lowest overall cost,\" the government said.Read MoreBiden admin intends to move forward with $23B UAE weapons salesThe aircraft beat bids from Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, the Rafale from France's Dassault and the four-nation Eurofighter built by Germany- and Spain-backed Airbus, Italy's Leonardo and Britain's BAE Systems.The decision drew immediate criticism from anti-armaments campaigners and left-wing parties who will now launch a campaign for a referendum on the issue, the third Swiss vote on buying fighter jets.Voters seven years ago rejected the purchase of Gripen jets from Sweden's Saab, while the 6 billion Swiss franc ($6.5 billion) funding, which led to the decision to buy the F-35As, was only narrowly approved last year.Opponents say Switzerland doesn't need cutting-edge warplanes to defend its Alpine territory, which a supersonic jet can cross in 10 minutes.US warplanes fly first combat missions off foreign aircraft carrier since World War II\"The decision is simply incomprehensible,\" said Priska Seiler Graf, a member of Parliament for the left-leaning Social Democrats (SP), who has raised concerns about the cost.\"It's not just about buying them, but the upkeep and operating costs,\" she added. \"We should seek a European solution ... we don't want to be dependent on the United States.\"The government picked the Patriot missile system over Franco-Italian group Eurosam.Defense Minister Viola Amherd said the F-35As were chosen after being the most impressive performer in an evaluation and offered best value for money.Total costs of 15.5 billion francs ($16.7 billion) came in 2 billion francs cheaper than the next lowest bidder, the government said, based on buying and operating the aircraft over 30 years.\"We would not have bought a Ferrari if a VW would do and the Ferrari would be three times more expensive,\" Amherd told a news conference.The Swiss Parliament now has to approve the funding for the purchase, with the debate scheduled for early next year. It can debate costs and terms but not revisit the model selection.Dozens of US Air Force F-35 fighters taxi on the runway in preparation for a combat power exercise on Nov. 19, 2018, at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The fighter decision was closely watched as the first of three face-offs ahead of Finland and Canada.Lockheed's stealthy fifth-generation fighter recently added Poland to its list of European customers which includes Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Britain.US President Joe Biden had lobbied for American companies when meeting his Swiss counterpart while in Geneva for his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month.JUST WATCHEDWatch US F-35 jet fighters arrive in Europe (2017)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch US F-35 jet fighters arrive in Europe (2017) 00:55Analysts said the decision to snub both the European fighter jet candidates and surface-to-air missile offering could be seen as a Swiss rebuff to the European Union in a time of strained relations between Bern and Brussels after the collapse of talks over a new agreement governing trade and other matters.By doubling down on US suppliers the government could antagonize the 49.8% of voters who opposed funding last year.South Korea rolls out the KF-21, joining elite group of global supersonic fighter jet makersAnti-arms campaigners say Switzerland, which last fought a foreign war more than 200 years ago and has no discernable enemies, does not need cutting-edge fighters.But supporters have said Switzerland needs to be able to protect itself without relying on others.Jonas Kampus, political secretary of the Group for a Switzerland without an Army, said he was confident of winning a referendum against the F-35As.The government \"can expect a heavy defeat in the vote. The follow-up polls in September (2020) showed a clear rejection of the F-35 among the voting population,\" he said.Marionna Schlatter, a lawmaker with the Greens Party said the September poll was too close to ignore opposition concerns.\"The people don't want a Ferrari in the air,\" she said.\n",

      "task_demos Input Text:  (CNN)A ban on cellphones in classrooms was announced in the Australian state of Victoria on Wednesday. The ban, which will apply to primary and secondary students, is designed to crack down on cyber-bulling and classroom distractions, the Victorian government said in a statement. While some schools in Australia have already banned cell-phone use, this marks the first statewide ban in the country. It will begin from the first school term of 2020.\"Students will be required to switch off their phones and store them securely in lockers from the start of the school day until the final bell. When emergencies occur, parents or guardians can reach their child by calling the school,\" the statement said.Victoria Education Minister James Merlino said he didn't expect the move to be \"universally popular\" but said it was the \"right thing to do\" on his official social media. Read MoreA report says young people are growing horns on their skulls. Critics don't buy itThe move isn't without precedent. Australia's largest state, New South Wales, banned mobile phones in primary schools in 2018, and France has banned all smart phones and smart devices from schools.Australian Education Minister Dan Tehan said in a statement that he supported the Victoria ban.\"When I talk to parents and teachers the overwhelming majority want action on banning mobile phones in the classroom,\" Tehan said in a statement. In a 2019 survey of about 2,000 Australian adults, by Monash University professor Neil Selywn, almost 80% supported a restriction on cell-phone use in schools, while one-third supported an outright ban.Ann Marie, a secondary school principal at a college in Victoria, told ABC Radio Melbourne that pupils at her school had agreed to restrict their mobile phone use during the day, explaining that they hoped to reduce \"bullying, distraction and one-upmanship.\"But there have been some concerns. The Australian Education Union Victoria said in a statement that while it supports the ban: \"We can't lose sight of the benefits that technology, including mobile phones, can bring to high quality teaching and learning.\"Some pupils with special needs will be exempt from the ban, including those who require telephones to monitor health conditions or those who have received permission from a teacher.  \n",

      "Input Text: Manchester, England (CNN)Boris Johnson wants to keep his Brexit plan private. But the Prime Minister isn't having much luck these days. On Monday night, Irish broadcaster RTE reported what it claimed were details of part of Johnson's plan to break the Brexit deadlock. According to RTE, the UK's plan to avoid post-Brexit infrastructure on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland involve \"customs clearance centers\" several miles from the border -- and on both sides of it. The women of Boris Johnson's past are starting to catch up with himThat, it hopes, will remove the need for something called the Irish border backstop from any final Brexit deal. The backstop is an emergency measure which would keep the two Irish nations in regulatory alignment, removing the need for any border or \"clearance centers\" at all. It's deeply unpopular with many in Johnson's Conservative party and is one of the main reasons his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.Ireland quickly dismissed the idea as a \"non starter\". And Johnson himself told the BBC on Tuesday, \"that's not what we're proposing at all... you'll forgive me, I would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity until we've been able to share them properly with our friends\". Read MoreSo why is this story a big deal? Keeping the government's formal proposals from Brussels for the time being might be wise. The crunch EU summit, at which any Brexit deal will be struck, is now under three weeks away. JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence vote 02:41The EU is a notoriously tough institution to negotiate with and has a history of tearing apart any Brexit proposal from the moment it leaves the door. Johnson has repeatedly said that the only way to make the EU budge on ditching the backstop is to show that he is both deadly serious about getting a deal but also prepared to leave without one. Some of the ideas reported by RTE chime with speculation about the UK government's plans in recent weeks.  And anyone who has followed Brexit for the last three years will tell you, the EU and Ireland will refuse to sign a deal that involves infrastructure between Ireland and Northern Ireland. So, even though the Prime Minister has distanced himself from the proposals, these headlines will have done little to reassure Brussels that Johnson and his government are serious about getting a deal. It's also a bad look for Johnson back home. He is currently out of London and at his Conservative party's annual conference in Manchester, in the north of England. Johnson will close the conference with a keynote speech on Wednesday afternoon. British politics has been taken over by trollsIt's widely thought that he wanted to trail his final Brexit plan during this speech before formally submitting something to Brussels in the subsequent days. The problem with the leak of any Brexit plan now is that it increases the risk of Johnson being greeted by a hostile audience at his conference on Wednesday. Despite being the Brexit hero of 2016, Conservative hard-Brexiteers are deeply worried that Johnson, if he succeeds in getting rid of the backstop, will simply try and push through the rest May's Brexit deal.For Brexiteers, this would be a huge sellout. There are people sitting in Johnson's cabinet who resigned from Theresa May's government to vote against her Brexit deal. And Johnson himself resigned as May's Foreign Secretary over her general approach to Brexit. Up here in Manchester, the mood among party members is generally positive. Johnson has always been a popular Conservative MP and he seems to have broad support for his hard Brexit language. That could turn sour if he's seen to make concessions to Brussels. Which would all be somewhat ironic, for a man who has spent the past few days accusing his opponents of surrendering. \n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Across the sports world, athletes took a stand for Black Lives Matter on Wednesday night by holding an unprecedented wildcat strike and refusing to play their regularly scheduled games.The decision started with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and stemmed from the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday. The stand quickly spread across a number of sports -- from basketball courts in Florida to baseball diamonds in California to soccer fields in places like Miami and Salt Lake City and even into the broadcast booth, where TNT's \"Inside the NBA\" analyst Kenny Smith took off his mic and walked off stage.But the issue is bigger than Jacob Blake or George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. Malcolm Jenkins of the NFL's New Orleans Saints positioned the protests as a response to the systemic racism baked into America, including police violence, cycles of incarceration, and the plunder of generational wealth.\"Until we continue to demand it, until 'Black Lives Matter' goes from just an idea or a goal that we're trying to attain as a society and is actually realized in the streets, we won't see any peace,\" he said. \"And I think we'll continue to see athletes, entertainers as well as citizens disrupt the status quo until that's recognized.\"Here's a look at the teams and athletes who pulled back in order to have their voices be heard.Read MoreNBA Photos: The sports world has been taking a standMembers of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat kneel during the National Anthem before Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, September 30.Hide Caption 1 of 42 Photos: The sports world has been taking a standThe Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Football Team stand together before their NFL season opener on September 13.Hide Caption 2 of 42 Photos: The sports world has been taking a standTyler Wright, a two-time World Surf League Champion, takes a knee before competing in an event in Tweed Heads South, Australia, on September 13.Hide Caption 3 of 42 Photos: The sports world has been taking a standTennis star Naomi Osaka wears a face mask with Tamir Rice's name before winning the US Open final on September 12.

That's what we're ready to do, but that doesn't come without, of course, demands of players to continue to amplify our voices in more ways than when we came here.\"We realize that the work is not easy, but we also understand that the work is never done. There are things that happen that just allow us times to take a moment -- that's fair; we can take a moment -- and that moment we came together and we decided we need time for ourselves to come back, regroup and continue to amplify our voices, and be there for our communities and demand change from the leaders that are representing us right now.\"MLBThe words 'Black Lives Matter' are displayed on the digital screen after the postponement of the game between the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday.Three MLB games were postponed Wednesday: Cincinnati Reds vs. Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners vs. San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants.\"With our community and our nation in such pain, we wanted to draw as much attention to the issues that really matter, especially racial injustice and systemic oppression,\" a joint statement from the Brewers and Reds said.\"Given the pain in the communities of Wisconsin and beyond following the shooting of Jacob Blake, we respect the decisions of a number of players not to play tonight,\" a league statement Wednesday said. \"Major League Baseball remains united for change in our society and we will be allies in the fight to end racism and injustice.\"Mets player Dominic Smith, who is Black, was driven to tears on Wednesday, telling reporters after the Mets defeated the Marlins, \"I think the most difficult part is to see people still don't care. And for this to continuously happen it just shows just the hate in people's heart and that just sucks. Being a Black man in America is not easy.\"On Thursday, seven games would not take place: Minnesota Twins vs. Detroit Tigers, Colorado Rockies vs. Arizona Diamondbacks, Baltimore Orioles vs. Tampa Bay Rays, Oakland Athletics vs. Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies vs. Washington Nationals, Boston Red Sox vs. Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins vs. New York Mets.Athletes across US sports take a stand, as games are called off in solidarity with Bucks' boycottIn a powerful moment Thursday at Citi Field in New York, the Mets starting defense took the field as scheduled, and then the remaining players for both teams came out of their dugouts and a moment of silence was observed, which the SNY television broadcast said lasted 42 seconds, and then walked off the field.Before he left the field, Miami Marlins player Lewis Brinson laid a \"Black Lives Matter\" shirt at home plate.\"Enough,\" the Marlins tweeted.Enough. pic.twitter.com/25SnNMCfBu— Miami Marlins (@Marlins) August 27, 2020 MLB is scheduled to observe Jackie Robinson Day on Friday to honor the color-barrier-breaking Hall of Famer, who wore number 42.NFLSeveral National Football League teams canceled practice Thursday to focus on conversations about race.The Denver Broncos joined the Arizona Cardinals, Indianapolis Colts, Washington Football Team and New York Jets in forgoing practice to allow players to weigh in on what they can do to effect change.The Chicago Bears said in a statement Thursday that the organization had decided to pause football activities \"to voice to each other, our coaches and our staff where we stand on the real issues around race and police brutality in our country.\"\"We had a productive discussion, but we all agreed that talks and discussions are simply not enough anymore and we need action,\" the statement said. \"We are putting in plans to take action in our communities and together we believe we can make a real difference.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of extracting entities and relationships from text, specifically focusing on identifying entities based on predefined types and determining the relationships between these entities. It works by using a language model to process the input text and entity types, generating a step-by-step reasoning process to identify and relate the entities, and finally outputting the entities and their relationships in a structured JSON format. The program ensures type annotations are enforced and includes mechanisms for handling errors and retries to improve the accuracy of the output.\n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)A ban on cellphones in classrooms was announced in the Australian state of Victoria on Wednesday. The ban, which will apply to primary and secondary students, is designed to crack down on cyber-bulling and classroom distractions, the Victorian government said in a statement. While some schools in Australia have already banned cell-phone use, this marks the first statewide ban in the country. It will begin from the first school term of 2020.\"Students will be required to switch off their phones and store them securely in lockers from the start of the school day until the final bell. When emergencies occur, parents or guardians can reach their child by calling the school,\" the statement said.Victoria Education Minister James Merlino said he didn't expect the move to be \"universally popular\" but said it was the \"right thing to do\" on his official social media. Read MoreA report says young people are growing horns on their skulls. Critics don't buy itThe move isn't without precedent. Australia's largest state, New South Wales, banned mobile phones in primary schools in 2018, and France has banned all smart phones and smart devices from schools.Australian Education Minister Dan Tehan said in a statement that he supported the Victoria ban.\"When I talk to parents and teachers the overwhelming majority want action on banning mobile phones in the classroom,\" Tehan said in a statement. In a 2019 survey of about 2,000 Australian adults, by Monash University professor Neil Selywn, almost 80% supported a restriction on cell-phone use in schools, while one-third supported an outright ban.Ann Marie, a secondary school principal at a college in Victoria, told ABC Radio Melbourne that pupils at her school had agreed to restrict their mobile phone use during the day, explaining that they hoped to reduce \"bullying, distraction and one-upmanship.\"But there have been some concerns. The Australian Education Union Victoria said in a statement that while it supports the ban: \"We can't lose sight of the benefits that technology, including mobile phones, can bring to high quality teaching and learning.\"Some pupils with special needs will be exempt from the ban, including those who require telephones to monitor health conditions or those who have received permission from a teacher.  \n",

      "Input Text: Manchester, England (CNN)Boris Johnson wants to keep his Brexit plan private. But the Prime Minister isn't having much luck these days. On Monday night, Irish broadcaster RTE reported what it claimed were details of part of Johnson's plan to break the Brexit deadlock. According to RTE, the UK's plan to avoid post-Brexit infrastructure on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland involve \"customs clearance centers\" several miles from the border -- and on both sides of it. The women of Boris Johnson's past are starting to catch up with himThat, it hopes, will remove the need for something called the Irish border backstop from any final Brexit deal. The backstop is an emergency measure which would keep the two Irish nations in regulatory alignment, removing the need for any border or \"clearance centers\" at all. It's deeply unpopular with many in Johnson's Conservative party and is one of the main reasons his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.Ireland quickly dismissed the idea as a \"non starter\". And Johnson himself told the BBC on Tuesday, \"that's not what we're proposing at all... you'll forgive me, I would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity until we've been able to share them properly with our friends\". Read MoreSo why is this story a big deal? Keeping the government's formal proposals from Brussels for the time being might be wise. The crunch EU summit, at which any Brexit deal will be struck, is now under three weeks away. JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence vote 02:41The EU is a notoriously tough institution to negotiate with and has a history of tearing apart any Brexit proposal from the moment it leaves the door. Johnson has repeatedly said that the only way to make the EU budge on ditching the backstop is to show that he is both deadly serious about getting a deal but also prepared to leave without one. Some of the ideas reported by RTE chime with speculation about the UK government's plans in recent weeks.  And anyone who has followed Brexit for the last three years will tell you, the EU and Ireland will refuse to sign a deal that involves infrastructure between Ireland and Northern Ireland. So, even though the Prime Minister has distanced himself from the proposals, these headlines will have done little to reassure Brussels that Johnson and his government are serious about getting a deal. It's also a bad look for Johnson back home. He is currently out of London and at his Conservative party's annual conference in Manchester, in the north of England. Johnson will close the conference with a keynote speech on Wednesday afternoon. British politics has been taken over by trollsIt's widely thought that he wanted to trail his final Brexit plan during this speech before formally submitting something to Brussels in the subsequent days. The problem with the leak of any Brexit plan now is that it increases the risk of Johnson being greeted by a hostile audience at his conference on Wednesday. Despite being the Brexit hero of 2016, Conservative hard-Brexiteers are deeply worried that Johnson, if he succeeds in getting rid of the backstop, will simply try and push through the rest May's Brexit deal.For Brexiteers, this would be a huge sellout. There are people sitting in Johnson's cabinet who resigned from Theresa May's government to vote against her Brexit deal. And Johnson himself resigned as May's Foreign Secretary over her general approach to Brexit. Up here in Manchester, the mood among party members is generally positive. Johnson has always been a popular Conservative MP and he seems to have broad support for his hard Brexit language. That could turn sour if he's seen to make concessions to Brussels. Which would all be somewhat ironic, for a man who has spent the past few days accusing his opponents of surrendering. \n",

      "Input Text:  (CNN)Across the sports world, athletes took a stand for Black Lives Matter on Wednesday night by holding an unprecedented wildcat strike and refusing to play their regularly scheduled games.The decision started with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and stemmed from the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday. The stand quickly spread across a number of sports -- from basketball courts in Florida to baseball diamonds in California to soccer fields in places like Miami and Salt Lake City and even into the broadcast booth, where TNT's \"Inside the NBA\" analyst Kenny Smith took off his mic and walked off stage.But the issue is bigger than Jacob Blake or George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. Malcolm Jenkins of the NFL's New Orleans Saints positioned the protests as a response to the systemic racism baked into America, including police violence, cycles of incarceration, and the plunder of generational wealth.\"Until we continue to demand it, until 'Black Lives Matter' goes from just an idea or a goal that we're trying to attain as a society and is actually realized in the streets, we won't see any peace,\" he said. \"And I think we'll continue to see athletes, entertainers as well as citizens disrupt the status quo until that's recognized.\"Here's a look at the teams and athletes who pulled back in order to have their voices be heard.Read MoreNBA Photos: The sports world has been taking a standMembers of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat kneel during the National Anthem before Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, September 30.Hide Caption 1 of 42 Photos: The sports world has been taking a standThe Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Football Team stand together before their NFL season opener on September 13.Hide Caption 2 of 42 Photos: The sports world has been taking a standTyler Wright, a two-time World Surf League Champion, takes a knee before competing in an event in Tweed Heads South, Australia, on September 13.Hide Caption 3 of 42 Photos: The sports world has been taking a standTennis star Naomi Osaka wears a face mask with Tamir Rice's name before winning the US Open final on September 12.

That's what we're ready to do, but that doesn't come without, of course, demands of players to continue to amplify our voices in more ways than when we came here.\"We realize that the work is not easy, but we also understand that the work is never done. There are things that happen that just allow us times to take a moment -- that's fair; we can take a moment -- and that moment we came together and we decided we need time for ourselves to come back, regroup and continue to amplify our voices, and be there for our communities and demand change from the leaders that are representing us right now.\"MLBThe words 'Black Lives Matter' are displayed on the digital screen after the postponement of the game between the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday.Three MLB games were postponed Wednesday: Cincinnati Reds vs. Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners vs. San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants.\"With our community and our nation in such pain, we wanted to draw as much attention to the issues that really matter, especially racial injustice and systemic oppression,\" a joint statement from the Brewers and Reds said.\"Given the pain in the communities of Wisconsin and beyond following the shooting of Jacob Blake, we respect the decisions of a number of players not to play tonight,\" a league statement Wednesday said. \"Major League Baseball remains united for change in our society and we will be allies in the fight to end racism and injustice.\"Mets player Dominic Smith, who is Black, was driven to tears on Wednesday, telling reporters after the Mets defeated the Marlins, \"I think the most difficult part is to see people still don't care.

The hiatus began in March, with Federer already sidelined since he was recuperating from knee surgery. Sunday would have marked the first day of the French Open in its usual spot on the tennis calendar -- in March, though, it was rescheduled for September -- and another grand slam, Wimbledon in July, was called off. \"I\\'m not training at the moment because I don\\'t see a reason for that to be honest,\" Federer told three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten -- who is raising funds for coronavirus relief efforts in his native Brazil -- in a video interview reported by Tennis.com.Read More\"I am happy with my body now and I still believe that the return of the tour\\xa0is a long way off,\" continued the 38-year-old. \"And I think it\\'s important\\xa0mentally to enjoy this break, having played so much tennis.\\xa0\"When I\\'m getting towards returning and have a goal to train for, I think I will be super motivated.\"We should be sliding into @rolandgarros right now, thinking of our mates in Paris 👋 pic.twitter.com/0PLKryyIjj— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) May 24, 2020 Federer is arguably tennis\\' best supported player ever, and the prospect of competing without spectators doesn\\'t appeal to him. \"Most of the time when we are training, there is no one,\" said the men\\'s record 20-time grand slam champion. \"For us, of course, it is possible to play if there are no fans.

The ban, which will apply to primary and secondary students, is designed to crack down on cyber-bulling and classroom distractions, the Victorian government said in a statement.

It will begin from the first school term of 2020.\"Students will be required to switch off their phones and store them securely in lockers from the start of the school day until the final bell.

Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men\\'s elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that\\'s why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it\\'s also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge\\'s world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year\\'s Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge\\'s record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night\\'s sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It\\'s a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn\\'t sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I\\'ve recovered well ... At this moment, I\\'m really strong. I hope I\\'ll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year\\'s New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele\\'s 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda\\'s Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has \\'the qualities of an ascetic monk\\'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya\\'s Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance\\'s two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city\\'s five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It\\'s more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands\\' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women\\'s race is headlined by Kenya\\'s Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA\\'s Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAnother athlete to keep an eye on is US star Shalane Flanagan as she attempts to run six marathons in 42 days. Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he\\'s grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year\\'s cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'KENENISA BEKELE',

Follow @cnnsport\\n\\nFor Williams that would mean winning a record-tying 24th grand slam title, which has so far proved elusive despite getting close four times since returning to the tour after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia. Her preparation for the year\\'s first major couldn\\'t have gone much better, suggesting the mini grand slam drought for arguably tennis\\' greatest ever player is about to cease. Williams let rip into a punching bag in December -- drawing a compliment from former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, whose daughter happens to be a budding tennis star -- and then won a buildup tournament in Auckland last week to incredibly land a title in a fourth straight decade. She also mingled with one of tennis\\' youngest sensations, Coco Gauff, as part of the training camp in Florida organized by her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. JUST WATCHEDMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroe 02:19Read MoreWilliams overcame singles opponents with differing styles, reached the doubles final with one of her best friends -- the soon-to-be retired Caroline Wozniacki -- and most crucially, ended a five-match losing streak in finals with her daughter and husband Alexis Ohanian looking on.  No wonder the 38-year-old said following her straight-set victory over fellow American Jessica Pegula: \"It\\'s pretty satisfying just to get a win in the final. That was really important for me. And I just want to build on it,\" added Williams, who donated her prize money check of $43,000 to bush fire relief efforts in Australia. \"It\\'s just a step towards the next goal.\"Indeed. READ: Can Rafael Nadal match Roger Federer\\'s all-time grand slam record?READ: Player brands Australian Open email a \\'slap in the face\\'Eyes on bigger prizeYes, as nice as it was to be holding the winners\\' trophy in Auckland -- where Williams once hit 88 unforced errors in a loss to Madison Brengle -- she didn\\'t make the long trip to simply prosper in New Zealand. The much bigger prize is the Australian Open, where Williams triumphed while in the early stages of pregnancy in 2017.  If Williams makes the final in Melbourne -- and she might have to defeat the likes of twice grand slam winner Naomi Osaka and current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty along the way -- she will probably have to then defeat someone with a heftier reputation than the 66th-ranked Pegula. Helping Williams, however, is that one of the main contenders, Bianca Andreescu, isn\\'t in Melbourne because of another injury, this time to a knee. But winning any final -- after losses in grand slam finals to Osaka, Andreescu, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and retiring against Andreescu in the Rogers Cup finale last August -- could potentially be turning point as Williams attempts to draw level with the grand slam haul of Australia\\'s Margaret Court.

Wimbledon is a lot of pressure, US Open is a lot of pressure. \"This one, the first one of the year, it\\'s a \\'Happy Slam,\\'\" referring to the Australian Open\\'s nickname. \"I think if she just takes a little bit of pressure off herself and she can just play her brand of tennis, I think she\\'s got a good shot at winning it.\"She\\'s better at grand slams than any other player when you look at the last two years.\"The way Wozniacki put it, Williams has a \"big chance\" to match Court. pic.twitter.com/skoZilynH8— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 12, 2020 Other high-profile players, such as Halep and former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova -- who saved four match points last year in Melbourne against Williams and rallied from 5-1 down in the third set after the American rolled her ankle -- aren\\'t discounting her chances, either, despite just falling short recently at grand slams. \"I\\'m very impressed about her, that she keeps playing at this level, with being a mother and also being a little bit older than us,\" said Halep, who made a mere three unforced errors in downing Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final. \"It\\'s impressive what she does.\"Challenges aheadBut Evert also underscored the stiffer challenges facing Williams. \"There are some darned good players out there that I have a lot of respect for, and the way that Osaka, Barty, Pliskova, Halep ... there\\'s not one or two threats to Serena, there\\'s probably about eight threats, eight players that can probably do some damage and that can compete against her.\"And one more thing is -- I always felt this way -- the older you get, I think the more bad days you may have, days when you feel burned out, days when you don\\'t want to get out of bed, days when you don\\'t have incentive.

Bekele\\'s 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda\\'s Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has \\'the qualities of an ascetic monk\\'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya\\'s Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance\\'s two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city\\'s five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It\\'s more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands\\' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women\\'s race is headlined by Kenya\\'s Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA\\'s Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics.

Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he\\'s grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year\\'s cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"', 'entity_types': ['PERSON', 'ORGANIZATION', 'LOCATION', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'MONEY', 'PERCENTAGE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'LANGUAGE', 'NATIONALITY', 'RELIGION', 'TITLE', 'PROFESSION', 'ANIMAL', 'PLANT', 'DISEASE', 'MEDICATION', 'CHEMICAL', 'MATERIAL', 'COLOR', 'SHAPE', 'MEASUREMENT', 'WEATHER', 'NATURAL_DISASTER', 'AWARD', 'LAW', 'CRIME', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SOFTWARE', 'HARDWARE', 'VEHICLE', 'FOOD', 'DRINK', 'SPORT', 'MUSIC_GENRE', 'INSTRUMENT', 'ARTWORK', 'BOOK', 'MOVIE', 'TV_SHOW', 'ACADEMIC_SUBJECT', 'SCIENTIFIC_THEORY', 'POLITICAL_PARTY', 'CURRENCY', 'STOCK_SYMBOL', 'FILE_TYPE', 'PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE', 'MEDICAL_PROCEDURE', 'CELESTIAL_BODY'], 'reasoning': 'produce the entities_relationships.

Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team\\'s name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the \"Eskimos\" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team\\'s long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there\\'s arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn\\'t just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don\\'t have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that\\'s troubling because that\\'s a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples\\' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, \\'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?\\'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples\\' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team\\'s mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club\\'s logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team\\'s logo can cause, but said it would remain the club\\'s logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn\\'t receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples\\' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar\\'s Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club\\'s stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant \\'Indio\\' it\\'s derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club\\'s mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club\\'s website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense\\'s mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn\\'t just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that\\'s very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that\\'s very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won\\'t change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters\\' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as \\'Indios.\\'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile\\'s most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club\\'s badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo\\'s badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn\\'t give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DENNIS BANKS', 'entity_type': 'PERSON',

Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men\\'s elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that\\'s why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it\\'s also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge\\'s world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year\\'s Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge\\'s record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night\\'s sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It\\'s a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn\\'t sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I\\'ve recovered well ... At this moment, I\\'m really strong. I hope I\\'ll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year\\'s New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele\\'s 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda\\'s Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has \\'the qualities of an ascetic monk\\'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya\\'s Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance\\'s two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city\\'s five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It\\'s more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands\\' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women\\'s race is headlined by Kenya\\'s Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA\\'s Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAnother athlete to keep an eye on is US star Shalane Flanagan as she attempts to run six marathons in 42 days. Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he\\'s grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year\\'s cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"', 'entity_types': ['PERSON', 'ORGANIZATION', 'LOCATION', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'MONEY', 'PERCENTAGE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'LANGUAGE', 'NATIONALITY', 'RELIGION', 'TITLE', 'PROFESSION', 'ANIMAL', 'PLANT', 'DISEASE', 'MEDICATION', 'CHEMICAL', 'MATERIAL', 'COLOR', 'SHAPE', 'MEASUREMENT', 'WEATHER', 'NATURAL_DISASTER', 'AWARD', 'LAW', 'CRIME', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SOFTWARE', 'HARDWARE', 'VEHICLE', 'FOOD', 'DRINK', 'SPORT', 'MUSIC_GENRE', 'INSTRUMENT', 'ARTWORK', 'BOOK', 'MOVIE', 'TV_SHOW', 'ACADEMIC_SUBJECT', 'SCIENTIFIC_THEORY', 'POLITICAL_PARTY', 'CURRENCY', 'STOCK_SYMBOL', 'FILE_TYPE', 'PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE', 'MEDICAL_PROCEDURE', 'CELESTIAL_BODY'], 'reasoning': 'produce the entities_relationships.

Either way, the sport won big in 2021. This year\\'s success starts with a boom in the sport\\'s fanbase that can be pinned to Netflix\\'s \"Drive to Survive\" docuseries. The show is a crash course on the 10 teams, the 20 drivers, the rivalries between them and the race competition structure. A word-of-mouth campaign for the series along with short, easy viewing episodes made it a perfect pandemic-time binge watch for millions around the world.The series\\' intimate interviews combined with the best action from races and the high level drama is a strong pitch for the real-life spectacle of Formula One.The multifaceted storytelling lets fans focus on the aspects of the sport that most appeal to them. And most importantly, \"Drive to Survive\" primed fans for an easy transition to the track when the 2021 season started.Read MoreThe popularity of the Netflix program, notably in the US, has paid dividends. ESPN says its race viewership in 2021 is up 56% over 2020. There was record attendance at the US Grand Prix in Austin this October -- drivers also credit the docuseries for the sport\\'s growth, including Hamilton himself. READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year\\'s constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans\\' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen\\'s car perched on top of Hamilton\\'s after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton\\'s brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen\\'s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\'s at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league\\'s first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.

for 50 years -- again and again.\"Why do these people continue to make a mockery of our culture?\" The question in 1970 was posed by Dennis Banks in reference to the use of Native American heritage being used for names and mascots for American sports teams. Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team\\'s name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the \"Eskimos\" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team\\'s long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there\\'s arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn\\'t just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don\\'t have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that\\'s troubling because that\\'s a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples\\' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, \\'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?\\'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples\\' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team\\'s mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club\\'s logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team\\'s logo can cause, but said it would remain the club\\'s logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn\\'t receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples\\' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar\\'s Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club\\'s stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant \\'Indio\\' it\\'s derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club\\'s mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club\\'s website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense\\'s mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn\\'t just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that\\'s very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that\\'s very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won\\'t change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters\\' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as \\'Indios.\\'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile\\'s most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club\\'s badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo\\'s badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn\\'t give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DENNIS BANKS', 'entity_type': 'PERSON',

league is exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or moreThe league helps players lose weight, but it also gives them a built-in support group (CNN)After reviewing restaurants for years, Andrew Shanahan became obese and was looking for a way to lose weight.But it wasn\\'t easy to find a program tailored to men. Every time he tried joining a weight-loss group, he was the only man in the room. \"I wondered how many other men felt that there was something missing and who weren\\'t getting the support that you desperately need when you\\'re trying to lose weight,\" he said.So in 2014, with the help of a crowdfunding campaign, Shanahan launched his Man v Fat initiative to reach out to other men like him. The idea drew attention from celebrities such as chef Jamie Oliver, and Shanahan was encouraged to write a book on it the next year. Being based in England, a soccer league seemed like a natural outreach program. And Shanahan received nearly 1,000 applications for 80 spots in the inaugural league, which was created exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or more.Read MorePhotographer Simone PerolariMany of the men used to play soccer -- or as it\\'s called in most of the world, football -- but their weight had become an obstacle in pursuing the sport they love.\"I saw people who want to have fun and slim down and believe in what they do,\" said Simone Perolari, who photographed the league and whose images can be seen in the gallery above. \"There is not a space for them in classic football, but some of them are really good players.\"Rob Bird, 40, read about the league in the Birmingham Mail. He played the sport until he was 25, and he calls the 15 years after that the \"fat years\" when he didn\\'t feel comfortable playing. \"I\\'ve always loved football, but playing against \\'normal-size\\' guys left me feeling like I couldn\\'t compete as they were faster,\" Bird said. \"(This league) is a level playing field for bigger guys.\" Shanahan isn\\'t sure what he was expecting to result from the league\\'s first season, but the competitiveness of the players surprised him. \"For a long time they haven\\'t had a level playing field to compete on, so they are all determined to give it everything they have,\" he said. \"Fortunately, even those teams who lose can see that the benefits of losing weight and getting healthy more than make up for not topping the league.\"Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Shanahan watched bonds form between the men as they enjoyed their favorite sport and supported one another in their goals to get fit and healthy. After 14 weeks, the 80 team members collectively lost 1,727 pounds, with the average weight loss close to 22 pounds per player. Marcus Farnsworth lost more than 70 pounds and is enjoying the energy boost he\\'s received in return. He hopes it will help with his knees and back as he continues to lose weight. But he also enjoyed the togetherness and support of the guys around him. \"It gives you good motivation if one person is feeling hungry or thinking about snacking,\" Farnsworth said. \"We can give advice and communicate through our WhatsApp group for support.\"Bird has dropped nearly 60 pounds and is now down to 210. His gout and leg ulcer have improved \"immeasurably.\"Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.Rob Bird, a player in the Man v Fat soccer league\"I feel a million times better,\" Bird said. \"This has given me the confidence that if you are making the right choices, you will feel better for it. Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.\"Shanahan is expanding the league across the rest of the United Kingdom beginning in July, and he hopes to start similar leagues in the United States and other countries. \"We saw a lot of health improvements, whether it was guys curing their sleep apnea, reversing their diabetes or lowering their blood pressure,\" Shanahan said. \"The other really notable thing was how much many of the players grew in confidence. \"I think it\\'s a great thing to undertake a project with other people who desperately want the same thing. It gives you energy and impetus. Working with the guys has been one of the greatest privileges of my career.

READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year\\'s constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans\\' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen\\'s car perched on top of Hamilton\\'s after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton\\'s brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen\\'s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\'s at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league\\'s first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.

Marcus Farnsworth lost more than 70 pounds and is enjoying the energy boost he\\'s received in return. He hopes it will help with his knees and back as he continues to lose weight.

It\\'s a job the Ecuadorean native has done for five years, after moving to the UK from Spain in 2013 while looking for work. CNN is not disclosing Anna\\'s real name as she fears repercussions from her employer.

Up to 20,000 people a day are failing to stay home when instructed to, according to Dido Harding, who is in charge of the country\\'s coronavirus Test and Trace scheme. \"These numbers are moving a lot,\" Harding told a parliamentary committee this week, adding that \"circa 20,000 people a day\" were currently not isolating. Harding said she was also concerned about people who were experiencing symptoms but had avoided being tested. For the British government, the lack of compliance is a significant worry.\"My biggest concern is...the people who feel ill but don\\'t come forward for testing at all,\" Harding said. One popular stereotype paints lockdown breakers as young and irreverent people who insist on attending house parties and meeting friends. But experts say the picture is more nuanced. The British public strongly supports lockdown, according to a YouGov poll released in January. Those who are not abiding by the rules often cannot afford to do so.Covid destroyed lives spent together. Now those left behind must say farewell by Zoom\"There\\'s so much emphasis on people not breaking the rules, but the majority are actually following the rules,\" says Muge Cevik, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.Cevik and her colleagues recently published an article in the British Medical Journal urging the government to offer greater support to people self isolating. Their paper points to a successful test-and-care model in San Francisco, which helped people isolate by ensuring home deliveries of goods, among other measures. A similar scheme in New York, which allowed people to opt to isolate in hotels, is also singled out for praise in the article.\"In the majority of hospitalizations what we\\'re seeing is that the majority of infections are among key workers,\" Cevik told CNN. \"We\\'re seeing huge outbreaks in warehouses, meat-packing plants, care homes ... the only thing that combines these sectors are low-paid workers, likely to live in crowded houses.\"In September 2020, the UK government rolled out a new package to support those in self-isolation. Lower income earners having to stay home may be eligible for a payment of £500 if they face losing pay. The penalty for those breaching lockdowns also increased, with those caught now facing  £1,000 ($1,370) fines.\"This new Test and Trace Support payment of £500 will ensure that those on low incomes are able to self-isolate without worry about their finances,\" the UK government said in a statement in September.But the £500 payment comes with stringent requirements -- to be eligible people need to already receive some form of UK government benefit, such as universal credit, working tax credit or housing benefit. Earlier this week, a study published by the Trades Union Congress found that fewer than 40% of applications for the grant were successful. Harding acknowledged during her committee appearance that lack of financial support was one reason that people failed to isolate. Cevik and her colleagues believe more needs to be done, including offering those in crowded homes the chance to self-isolate in separate accommodation, to curb the virus\\' spread.\"If someone has tested positive, [then] at the time of testing, we could be asking them \\'do you have space to isolate? And do you get sick leave?\\'\" she says.\"These [resources] need to come as a package -- income relief, sick leave [and] accommodation is needed.\"Anna says she would \"of course\" have stayed home if she had been given more support.\"I would have stayed home from the first day,\" she told CNN. \"I felt bad, but ... low-wage workers had no choice.\"A digital display at a bus station warns pedestrians of the new strain of coronavirus in central London on January 8.\"I don\\'t blame people who are desperate, and [make that choice to work],\" says Yaseen Aslam, president of the ACDU, a union representing private hire and courier drivers in Britain.\"I know a driver who had to isolate four times in two months, How does that work?\" Aslam told CNN. \"The problem is, drivers are making at the moment £35 or £50 daily,\" he adds. \"The £500 [payment], yeah that\\'s good but the drivers are desperate.\"And when you\\'re in a desperate situation, you take risks.

The pilot scheme was done in partnership with motoring assistance group, the AA, across Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham, in northern England. But outside the scheme, drivers must decide whether to pay to install the screens. But one driver,\\xa0who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from his employer,\\xa0said he and his peers were not installing the screens as they simply could not afford to.\"This is a pandemic,\" the man, who says he works as a driver in London, said. \"It\\'s not going to last forever -- why should I put that in if it\\'s not going to last forever?\"Aslam also works with the International Alliance of App-Based Transport Workers, an organization that brings together private hire drivers worldwide.\"I work with drivers in France, Amsterdam, San Francisco [and so on,]\" he said. \"We\\'re seeing these problems across the world.

The Dutch demonstrations lasted for a few nights in late January and turned violent. Anti-lockdown protesters have also taken to the streets in the UK, most notably in multiple demonstrations in November 2020. Dozens of people have been arrested during the marches, at which some protesters have shared conspiracy theories about Covid-19.\"If people feel vulnerable, then they will comply with lockdown rules,\" Pamela Briggs, a professor of applied psychology at Northumbria University, told CNN. \"For those who feel less vulnerable, then compliance becomes more of a matter of civic duty.\"If you\\'re going to make sacrifices then you have to believe they\\'ll be effective,\" she adds. \"The problem comes when people can\\'t understand why they are being asked to do these things... if people feel the rules don\\'t make sense, they\\'re more likely to challenge them.\"Briggs believes that people need to believe their sacrifice in staying home is worth the personal cost. The UK\\'s three lockdowns have, to various extents, helped to curb rising cases.\"We could make people feel that their sacrifices are genuinely having an effect,\" Briggs said.\"There are ways to demonstrate the efficacy of lockdown and more should be done.\"One year into the Covid crisis, the UK government continues to use lockdowns as a last resort. Some good news awaits on the horizon -- cases are beginning to drop and the country\\'s vaccine rollout has been widely praised. What officials now face is the challenge of helping people stay home, in the face of overwhelming mental and financial fatigue.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'ANNA', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'A 37-year-old Ecuadorean native who cleans an office building in London during the pandemic.', 'importance_score': 0.9}, {'entity_name': 'UK', 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'description': 'The United Kingdom, where Anna moved from Spain in 2013 and currently lives.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'LONDON', 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'description': 'A city in the UK where Anna works and lives.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'COVID-19', 'entity_type': 'DISEASE', 'description': 'The disease that Anna caught and had to recover from.', 'importance_score': 0.9}, {'entity_name': 'CNN', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'The news organization that interviewed Anna and reported her story.', 'importance_score': 0.6}], 'relationships': [{'src_id': 'ANNA', 'tgt_id': 'UK', 'description': 'Anna moved to the UK from Spain in 2013.', 'weight': 0.8, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'ANNA', 'tgt_id': 'LONDON', 'description': 'Anna works and lives in London.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'ANNA', 'tgt_id': 'COVID-19', 'description': 'Anna caught Covid-19 and had to recover from it.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'ANNA', 'tgt_id': 'CNN', 'description': \"Anna's story was reported by CNN.\", 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}]}) (input_keys={'input_text'}), Example({'input_text': 'Story highlightsThe phone was auctioned Sunday by a Maryland auction house and was bought by phone bidderThe \"mobile device of destruction\" was recovered from Nazi leader\\'s bunker by British officer (CNN)Adolf Hitler\\'s telephone was sold at auction in the United States on Sunday for $243,000. The winning bid was made by phone but the name of the bidder has not been released.The phone was presented to Hitler by the Wehrmacht and was used by the Nazi leader to issue most of his commands during the last two years of World War II, according to a description in the catalog for Alexander Historical Auctions in Maryland.The phone was recovered from the Fuhrerbunker in 1945 and has been kept in a box in an English country house ever since. Made by Siemens as a black Bakelite phone, it was later painted red and engraved with Hitler\\'s name and a swastika, the catalog says.The auction house describes the telephone as \"Hitler\\'s mobile device of destruction\" and called it \"arguably the most destructive \\'weapon\\' of all time, which sent millions to their deaths around the world.\"Hitler\\'s name is engraved on the back of the phone, along with an eagle and swastika.Read MoreBritish officer Ralph Rayner recovered the phone from Hitler\\'s bunker while visiting Berlin on the orders of Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery just a few days after the end of the war, according to Rayner\\'s personal account and shipping documents from that time period, according to the auction house. His son Ranulf Rayner, 82, inherited the phone after his father\\'s death in 1977. \"My father didn\\'t see it as a relic of Hitler\\'s glory days, more a battered remnant of his defeat, a sort of war trophy,\" he told CNN. \"He never thought it would become an important artifact.\"Ralph Rayner would have been \"chuffed to bits\" that the phone has had so much attention, his son said.He had hoped the phone would fetch a larger sum, but he is happy to be able to say goodbye to it.\"I certainly won\\'t miss it,\" he told CNN. \"It\\'s a fairly sinister bit of kit and I\\'ve always lived in fear of someone trying to steal it.

In his words, it was a \"dreadful hellhole.\" First offered the black telephone found in the room of Eva Braun, Hitler\\'s bride, Ralph Rayner instead chose the red phone next to Hitler\\'s bed. \"He told the Russians that red was his favorite color,\" Ranulf Rayner said, \"which the Russians rather liked.\"In a letter to his wife Elizabeth on May 18, 1945, Ralph Rayner wrote of the \"utter horror\" he witnessed in Berlin, but did not mention the remarkable souvenir he had in his possession.If British soldiers were caught looting from the Germans, Ranulf Rayner explained, they would face a court martial.Ralph Rayner returned to Devon in western England with both the phone and a porcelain model of an Alsatian, also taken from the bunker, hidden in his suitcase.Ralph Rayner also recovered a porcelain Alsatian from Hitler\\'s bunker.The china dog, made by slave laborers at Dachau concentration camp and probably presented to Hitler by Heinrich Himmler, SS chief and architect of the Final Solution, was also auctioned Sunday.

After scrapping the plan to slash $4 billion in foreign aid, Trump said his team would look to find cuts elsewhere in the aid budget.\"The President has made no secret when it comes to foreign assistance that US interests abroad should be prioritized and other foreign countries should also be paying their fair share,\" a senior administration official told CNN.Specifically, Trump has directed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and national security adviser John Bolton to oversee the process, the senior administration official said. The President has not yet made a final decision on whether to permanently block the funds, an administration official told CNN. The review process, however, has effectively paused disbursement of the funds, which are set to expire on September 30 if they are not used.Read MoreJames Mattis: \\'I had no choice but to leave\\' the Trump administrationThe Pentagon has already recommended to the White House that the hold on military assistance to Ukraine be lifted, an administration official and a US defense official told CNN Thursday. A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.\"We do not publicly comment on internal budget deliberations. For further inquiries, I direct you to the White House Office of Management and Budget,\" said spokesperson Lt. Col. Carla Gleason.However the hold on the aid remains in place, as it is the White House\\'s call whether to lift it, the administration official said, fueling uncertainty within the administration about what will happen to the spending after the review is formally completed.In the meantime, agencies are authorized and encouraged to execute all processes to prepare for the obligation of those funds but must wait to obligate them until the policy review is complete and the President has made a final determination, the senior official said. Bipartisan angerIf Trump ultimately decides to block the aid package, a possibility first reported by Politico, it would likely prompt a bipartisan uproar from members of Congress who believe US military support is essential to countering Russia\\'s military involvement in Ukraine.Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voiced his strong opposition to that idea in a tweet Thursday: \"This is unacceptable. It was wrong when Obama failed to stand up to Putin in Ukraine, and it\\'s wrong now.\"Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez released a statement accusing the administration of circumventing Congress and \"undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support.\"\"In willfully delaying these funds, the Trump Administration is once again trying to circumvent Congress\\' Constitutional prerogative of appropriating funds for U.S. government agencies. It is also undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support,\" he said.\"Enough is enough. President Trump should stop worrying about disappointing Vladimir Putin and stand up for U.S. national security priorities,\" Menendez added.What will Trump do?Multiple sources familiar with the issue tell CNN that the President has floated the idea of halting the funding program for weeks. The White House has recently notified relevant agencies and congressional committees of its intent to block the aid to Ukraine, one source said.However, sources say that there are still questions about what Trump will ultimately do. Trump privately clashed with G7 leaders over reinviting PutinThe push to block the aid package has been supported by Trump\\'s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney but opposed by some within the State Department and national security council, according to another source. National security adviser John Bolton was in Kiev Wednesday, where he met with Ukrainian officials, but there is little indication he raised the possibility of blocking the funding.\"It was great to meet with my Ukrainian national security and defense colleagues in Kyiv. The discussions clearly show that we share a common commitment to preserving Ukraine\\'s security and sovereignty, and to ensuring it is not subject to Chinese economic exploitation,\" Bolton tweeted Wednesday. A US Department of State official told CNN on Thursday that the policy on Ukraine has not changed, adding the US remains committed to a robust partnership between the two countries. But Trump\\'s public deference to Putin and Russia has alarmed US allies and lawmakers. The issue has only been amplified by Trump\\'s recent comments at the G7 summit, in which he seemingly downplayed Russia\\'s military incursion in Ukraine and suggested that Russia be reinstated into the group of leading global economies.The US has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in security assistance since 2014 as it has sought to bolster the country\\'s military, which is facing an ongoing conflict with separatists in the country\\'s east, forces the Pentagon believes are backed, armed and even led by Moscow.In 2017, the Trump administration announced its decision to provide lethal anti-tank weapons, including US-made Javelin missiles, to Ukraine. \"Since 2014, there has been broad bipartisan support in the Senate for security assistance to Ukraine. If Trump\\'s OMB is really playing games with Ukrainian security assistance, then the response from Congress will be fierce. At the very least, Trump\\'s OMB should get out of the way and release the funds that Congress has already appropriated,\" a senior Democratic aide told CNN. Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Wednesday that such a move would be \"destructive to our national security\" and suggested that the decision is politically motivated. \"Trump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent. It doesn\\'t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security,\" Schiff wrote.Giuliani pushes for Biden investigationRudy Giuliani, who serves as Trump\\'s personal attorney, has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s call in 2016 to remove the country\\'s top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden\\'s son, Hunter.Last week, Giuliani said he had again raised the issue with a Ukrainian official, suggesting the former New York mayor is making a renewed push for the country to investigate Trump\\'s political enemies.Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor\\'s dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden\\'s move was inappropriate.Ukraine\\'s prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.Giuliani says he met with Ukrainian official to discuss BidenThe Biden campaign refused comment on Giuliani\\'s talks. The New York Times first reported Giuliani\\'s talks with the official. Asked Thursday if he\\'s spoken to the President at all about the military assistance to Ukraine, Giuliani told CNN: \"No, not in on it.\"Giuliani told CNN that the State Department informed him that Andriy Yermak, who he called the lawyer for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, wanted to meet with him. Yermak was appointed as an aide to Zelensky in May, according to local media reports.The two spoke twice over the phone, with Yermak offering to come to the US to meet with Giuliani before the two agreed to meet in Madrid last month, Giuliani said.Giuliani claims that Yermak asked him questions and that he didn\\'t ask the Ukrainian lawyer to do anything because he \"didn\\'t need to.\" The focus of their conversation was on Biden\\'s possible role as then-vice president in the prosecutor\\'s dismissal and how Ukraine may have tried to damage Trump\\'s campaign, Giuliani said.The State Department confirmed last week that it had assisted in connecting Yermak and Giuliani.CNN\\'s Ryan Browne, Michael Warren and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'President of the United States, considering a plan to block military assistance to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 1.0}, {'entity_name': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'President of Russia, with whom Trump seeks to ingratiate himself.', 'importance_score': 0.9}, {'entity_name': 'UKRAINE', 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'description': 'Country receiving military assistance from the US, which Trump is considering blocking.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'MARK ESPER', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'Defense Secretary overseeing the review of the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'JOHN BOLTON', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'National security adviser involved in the review process.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'PENTAGON', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'US Department recommending the lifting of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 0.6}, {'entity_name': 'WHITE HOUSE', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'Administration making the final decision on the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'CONGRESS', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'Legislative body expressing bipartisan opposition to blocking the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'ADAM KINZINGER', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'Republican Representative opposing the blocking of aid to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 0.6}, {'entity_name': 'BOB MENENDEZ', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"Democratic Senator criticizing the administration's handling of the aid package.\", 'importance_score': 0.6}], 'relationships': [{'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'UKRAINE', 'description': 'Trump is considering blocking military assistance to Ukraine.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN', 'description': \"Trump's decision to block aid to Ukraine would ingratiate him with Putin.\", 'weight': 0.8, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'MARK ESPER', 'description': 'Trump has directed Esper to oversee the review of the aid package.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'JOHN BOLTON', 'description': 'Trump has directed Bolton to oversee the review process.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'PENTAGON', 'tgt_id': 'WHITE HOUSE', 'description': 'The Pentagon has recommended to the White House that the hold on military assistance to Ukraine be lifted.', 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'CONGRESS', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Congress is expressing bipartisan opposition to Trump's decision to block the aid package.\", 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'ADAM KINZINGER', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Kinzinger opposes Trump's idea of blocking aid to Ukraine.\", 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'BOB MENENDEZ', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Menendez criticizes the administration's handling of the aid package.\", 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 2}]}) (input_keys={'input_text'})], [Example({'augmented': True, 'input_text': 'London (CNN)Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is being treated for an infection and is not expected to leave the hospital for several days, according to an update from Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.\"The Duke of Edinburgh remains at King Edward VII\\'s Hospital where he is receiving medical attention for an infection.

After scrapping the plan to slash $4 billion in foreign aid, Trump said his team would look to find cuts elsewhere in the aid budget.\"The President has made no secret when it comes to foreign assistance that US interests abroad should be prioritized and other foreign countries should also be paying their fair share,\" a senior administration official told CNN.Specifically, Trump has directed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and national security adviser John Bolton to oversee the process, the senior administration official said. The President has not yet made a final decision on whether to permanently block the funds, an administration official told CNN. The review process, however, has effectively paused disbursement of the funds, which are set to expire on September 30 if they are not used.Read MoreJames Mattis: \\'I had no choice but to leave\\' the Trump administrationThe Pentagon has already recommended to the White House that the hold on military assistance to Ukraine be lifted, an administration official and a US defense official told CNN Thursday. A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.\"We do not publicly comment on internal budget deliberations. For further inquiries, I direct you to the White House Office of Management and Budget,\" said spokesperson Lt. Col. Carla Gleason.However the hold on the aid remains in place, as it is the White House\\'s call whether to lift it, the administration official said, fueling uncertainty within the administration about what will happen to the spending after the review is formally completed.In the meantime, agencies are authorized and encouraged to execute all processes to prepare for the obligation of those funds but must wait to obligate them until the policy review is complete and the President has made a final determination, the senior official said. Bipartisan angerIf Trump ultimately decides to block the aid package, a possibility first reported by Politico, it would likely prompt a bipartisan uproar from members of Congress who believe US military support is essential to countering Russia\\'s military involvement in Ukraine.Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voiced his strong opposition to that idea in a tweet Thursday: \"This is unacceptable. It was wrong when Obama failed to stand up to Putin in Ukraine, and it\\'s wrong now.\"Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez released a statement accusing the administration of circumventing Congress and \"undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support.\"\"In willfully delaying these funds, the Trump Administration is once again trying to circumvent Congress\\' Constitutional prerogative of appropriating funds for U.S. government agencies. It is also undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support,\" he said.\"Enough is enough. President Trump should stop worrying about disappointing Vladimir Putin and stand up for U.S. national security priorities,\" Menendez added.What will Trump do?Multiple sources familiar with the issue tell CNN that the President has floated the idea of halting the funding program for weeks. The White House has recently notified relevant agencies and congressional committees of its intent to block the aid to Ukraine, one source said.However, sources say that there are still questions about what Trump will ultimately do. Trump privately clashed with G7 leaders over reinviting PutinThe push to block the aid package has been supported by Trump\\'s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney but opposed by some within the State Department and national security council, according to another source. National security adviser John Bolton was in Kiev Wednesday, where he met with Ukrainian officials, but there is little indication he raised the possibility of blocking the funding.\"It was great to meet with my Ukrainian national security and defense colleagues in Kyiv. The discussions clearly show that we share a common commitment to preserving Ukraine\\'s security and sovereignty, and to ensuring it is not subject to Chinese economic exploitation,\" Bolton tweeted Wednesday. A US Department of State official told CNN on Thursday that the policy on Ukraine has not changed, adding the US remains committed to a robust partnership between the two countries. But Trump\\'s public deference to Putin and Russia has alarmed US allies and lawmakers. The issue has only been amplified by Trump\\'s recent comments at the G7 summit, in which he seemingly downplayed Russia\\'s military incursion in Ukraine and suggested that Russia be reinstated into the group of leading global economies.The US has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in security assistance since 2014 as it has sought to bolster the country\\'s military, which is facing an ongoing conflict with separatists in the country\\'s east, forces the Pentagon believes are backed, armed and even led by Moscow.In 2017, the Trump administration announced its decision to provide lethal anti-tank weapons, including US-made Javelin missiles, to Ukraine. \"Since 2014, there has been broad bipartisan support in the Senate for security assistance to Ukraine. If Trump\\'s OMB is really playing games with Ukrainian security assistance, then the response from Congress will be fierce. At the very least, Trump\\'s OMB should get out of the way and release the funds that Congress has already appropriated,\" a senior Democratic aide told CNN. Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Wednesday that such a move would be \"destructive to our national security\" and suggested that the decision is politically motivated. \"Trump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent. It doesn\\'t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security,\" Schiff wrote.Giuliani pushes for Biden investigationRudy Giuliani, who serves as Trump\\'s personal attorney, has long lobbied Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s call in 2016 to remove the country\\'s top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden\\'s son, Hunter.Last week, Giuliani said he had again raised the issue with a Ukrainian official, suggesting the former New York mayor is making a renewed push for the country to investigate Trump\\'s political enemies.Other Western governments also called for that prosecutor\\'s dismissal, and no evidence has indicated Biden\\'s move was inappropriate.Ukraine\\'s prosecutor general told Bloomberg in May he had no proof of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.Giuliani says he met with Ukrainian official to discuss BidenThe Biden campaign refused comment on Giuliani\\'s talks. The New York Times first reported Giuliani\\'s talks with the official. Asked Thursday if he\\'s spoken to the President at all about the military assistance to Ukraine, Giuliani told CNN: \"No, not in on it.\"Giuliani told CNN that the State Department informed him that Andriy Yermak, who he called the lawyer for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, wanted to meet with him. Yermak was appointed as an aide to Zelensky in May, according to local media reports.The two spoke twice over the phone, with Yermak offering to come to the US to meet with Giuliani before the two agreed to meet in Madrid last month, Giuliani said.Giuliani claims that Yermak asked him questions and that he didn\\'t ask the Ukrainian lawyer to do anything because he \"didn\\'t need to.\" The focus of their conversation was on Biden\\'s possible role as then-vice president in the prosecutor\\'s dismissal and how Ukraine may have tried to damage Trump\\'s campaign, Giuliani said.The State Department confirmed last week that it had assisted in connecting Yermak and Giuliani.CNN\\'s Ryan Browne, Michael Warren and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'President of the United States, considering a plan to block military assistance to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 1.0}, {'entity_name': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'President of Russia, with whom Trump seeks to ingratiate himself.', 'importance_score': 0.9}, {'entity_name': 'UKRAINE', 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'description': 'Country receiving military assistance from the US, which Trump is considering blocking.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'MARK ESPER', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'Defense Secretary overseeing the review of the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'JOHN BOLTON', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'National security adviser involved in the review process.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'PENTAGON', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'US Department recommending the lifting of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 0.6}, {'entity_name': 'WHITE HOUSE', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'Administration making the final decision on the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'CONGRESS', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'Legislative body expressing bipartisan opposition to blocking the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'ADAM KINZINGER', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'Republican Representative opposing the blocking of aid to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 0.6}, {'entity_name': 'BOB MENENDEZ', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"Democratic Senator criticizing the administration's handling of the aid package.\", 'importance_score': 0.6}], 'relationships': [{'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'UKRAINE', 'description': 'Trump is considering blocking military assistance to Ukraine.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN', 'description': \"Trump's decision to block aid to Ukraine would ingratiate him with Putin.\", 'weight': 0.8, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'MARK ESPER', 'description': 'Trump has directed Esper to oversee the review of the aid package.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'JOHN BOLTON', 'description': 'Trump has directed Bolton to oversee the review process.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'PENTAGON', 'tgt_id': 'WHITE HOUSE', 'description': 'The Pentagon has recommended to the White House that the hold on military assistance to Ukraine be lifted.', 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'CONGRESS', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Congress is expressing bipartisan opposition to Trump's decision to block the aid package.\", 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'ADAM KINZINGER', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Kinzinger opposes Trump's idea of blocking aid to Ukraine.\", 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'BOB MENENDEZ', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Menendez criticizes the administration's handling of the aid package.\", 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 2}]}) (input_keys={'input_text'}), Example({'input_text': 'Story highlightsMeltzer completes 3,524 km in under 46 daysBeats rival Jurek\\'s year-long recordRan for 15 hours each day (CNN)He stands at the foot of Maine\\'s Mount Katahdin.

It mainly covers a terrain of forest trails and open fields, but also traverses roads, towns and farms, taking in some breathtaking scenery.The Trail would take hikers about six months to complete in its entirety, but Meltzer\\'s record took just a quarter of that, though his record attempt has been nearly a decade in the making.\"I\\'ve been trying to do it for nine years and the Appalachian Trail has been one of my favorite trails ever to run on,\" he told CNN. \"Now, after trying three times, I finally get the chance to say I\\'m the king of the AT.\" The previous record of 46 days, eight hours and seven minutes was held by Scott Jurek, a friend, training partner, and rival of Meltzer. Jurek ran his record from south to north, the opposite way to his counterpart. \"It was great to beat Scott Jurek\\'s record, too,\" said Meltzer, \"and to have him there at the end to run with me. It was really an honor and inspiration. Now it\\'s my turn to hand over the baton to someone else.\"\\'A long journey of misery\\': Ultrarunners -- a rare breed After one and a half months of four o\\'clock starts in the morning in order to run 50 miles, Meltzer\\'s feat was grueling and, in his own words, miserable.But the 48-year-old is by no means alone in his quest to carry his body over immense distances.An ultramarathon refers to any race longer than 42.195 km (26.219 miles), the length of a regular marathon. They can take place over a succession of days, or simply involve a single race, usually measuring between 50 and 200 km.Competitors at the Marathon des Sables in MoroccoThese races are often made worse by punishing conditions overhead and underfoot. The Marathon des Sables (MDS), for example, is a six-day, 251-km race across the Sahara Desert. Not only is the soft sand notoriously difficult to run on, but temperatures also often exceed 120°F (50°C). It\\'s not for the fainthearted. Blisters can develop from the smallest grain of sand getting in your shoes, and feet can swell from the heat. There are also more long-term problems: research has suggested that running such extreme distances may cause damage to heart tissue.Read: How to survive a desert marathonThe Badwater Ultramarathon vies with the MDS for the title of the world\\'s toughest footrace. The 135-mile course in California\\'s Death Valley reaches temperatures similar to those in the Sahara. Contestants are often seen wearing full body white suits as protection from UV light. It is estimated that 20-40% of runners on the start line fail to reach the finish.A lonely runner at BadwaterThen there\\'s the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run in Colorado that covers 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of elevation 13 times. The quickest time is a mere 22 hours 41 minutes. Meltzer has won this race five times -- more than any other man (Betsy Kalmeyer has the most female wins, also with five.) He\\'s completed 89 ultramarathons in his career and has won 38 100-mile races -- again, more than any other man -- having racked up six wins at the Wastach 100 and five at the Squaw Peak 50.But despite his breathtaking stamina, Meltzer is still human, snacking on candy, and ended each day on the Trail with a cold beer. Record broken, he now intends to catch up on sleep and play some golf.But of course he\\'s got a world record for that, too, having played the most holes ever (230) in 12 hours.

Russia has been building up forces and equipment near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending troops into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a \"full-fledged theater of operations\" from which to launch an attack.US intelligence officials have said they don\\'t know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to do so, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia\\'s western flank.Read MoreUkrainian soldiers in a front line trench near pro-Russian separatists take shelter from the extreme cold. After high-level talks between Moscow and Washington wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on Ukraine\\'s border, prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy have been cast into doubt. Now the Biden administration is weighing whether to deploy as many as 5,000 US troops, according to a senior defense official, to shore up NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics.  On Monday, both NATO and Russia pointed the finger at each other for the ratcheting tensions. \"Tensions are escalating due to concrete actions taken by the US and NATO,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to NATO\\'s announcement.\"I mean the informational hysteria that we are witnessing -- it is generously framed by a huge amount of false information, just lies and fakes,\" Peskov added.Biden administration identifying troops for possible deployment to Eastern Europe amid Russia tensionsNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Monday statement that the alliance would continue to take necessary measures \"to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance.\" He added: \"We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.\"The NATO statement said that in recent days, a flurry of member states had announced deployments to the region. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania, the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria, France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. Stoltenberg cautioned in a news conference on Monday that the moves were defensive and proportionate -- and that NATO was \"not threatening Russia.\" There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. NATO, Europe and the US have been united in their opposition to any further Russian incursion in Ukraine, promising to lend support to Ukraine and hand down \"massive costs\" for Moscow in the event they make a move. But the shape of that response and what steps they might take are still unclear.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday warned that \"a single additional Russian force\" entering Ukraine \"in an aggressive way\" would result in a severe response by the US and its allies. His comments came after US President Joe Biden muddled the message of severe consequences last week, saying at a news conference that a \"minor incursion\" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. The President later clarified that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine\\'s border would constitute an invasion.CNN reported last week that the US military goal would be to \"meet the capability\" NATO allies in the region are asking for, a defense official said. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that as many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened preparedness to deploy.Local residents Marinka, Ukraine, walk past an apartment building destroyed during fighting in 2015 between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed separatists. Fighting is still ongoing.The mobilization of Western forces comes amid a significant uptick in Russia\\'s military movements, not only on Ukraine\\'s border -- where the Ukrainian Defense Ministry says there are now 127,000 Russian troops stationed -- but elsewhere in Europe. The Russian Defense Ministry announced last week that 140 ships and 10,000 servicemen would take part in sweeping exercises from the Pacific to the Atlantic, including off Ireland\\'s southwest coast in February. The ministry said the main purpose of the drills is to protect Russia\\'s national interests in the world\\'s oceans, TASS state news agency reported.In Ukraine, one question looms: What will we do if Russia attacks? Ireland\\'s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told reporters on Monday that he had raised concerns with Moscow about Russia\\'s plans. \"This isn\\'t the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what\\'s happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,\" Coveney said. Coveney and other European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the security situation in Ukraine and what action to take should Russia cross into Ukrainian territory; Blinken joined by video link following talks with Lavrov in Geneva. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the \"most comprehensive\" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said.But while NATO countries ramp up readiness and the EU discusses heightened security concerns, Ukraine\\'s own government has not, at least outwardly, signaled the same sense of urgency. In a call with the President of the European Council Charles Michel on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country will not succumb to provocations, but would \"keep calm.\" Zelensky and his government have previously downplayed the danger of a Russian invasion, noting that the threat has existed for years and has not become greater in recent months. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been rumbling since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine\\'s east. Despite a cease fire in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace.Tensions are high on Ukraine\\'s border with Russia. Here\\'s what you need to knowUkraine on Monday criticized the US\\' decision to withdraw diplomats\\' families and reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, with Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, saying in a tweet: \"We believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution.\" But other countries are also taking precautions in Kyiv, Ukraine\\'s capital. The UK Foreign Office also announced Monday that some British Embassy staff and dependents were being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to \"growing threats from Russia.\" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that the intelligence around the situation in Ukraine was \"gloomy\" but that war was not inevitable.Speaking to reporters at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, the bloc\\'s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Europe will seek to simmer tensions between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy first but warned Moscow it is prepared to take action if necessary. He also urged for calm, stressing the need to avoid \"alarmist reactions that could that could lead to an escalation. We don\\'t want people to have a breakdown on this.\"  Borrell added that the EU had no current plans to evacuate diplomatic staff and their families from Ukraine.Eliza Mackintosh wrote and reported in London.

READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year\\'s constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans\\' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen\\'s car perched on top of Hamilton\\'s after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton\\'s brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen\\'s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\'s at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league\\'s first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.

Anna says she cleans an office building in London which is open but nearly empty, as most staff are working from home. It\\'s a job the Ecuadorean native has done for five years, after moving to the UK from Spain in 2013 while looking for work. CNN is not disclosing Anna\\'s real name as she fears repercussions from her employer. Anna\\'s employer insisted that she continue to clean the building during the pandemic but cut her hours from five a day to four. She earns £10.75 ($14.77) per hour.\"I have been forced to go to work in a nonessential building,\" she told CNN. \"There is no one at work, I\\'m alone.\"Read MoreLast month Anna caught Covid-19. She\\'s unsure where she picked it up from but said it was likely \"on the bus or on the Underground.\" She lives in south London in a shared house and says that at first the virus left her exhausted.The healthcare workers watching from afar as rich countries begin vaccine rollout \"I had a lot of coughs, fever, fatigue... and dizziness,\" she said. \"And I [am taking a long time to recover] because this disease is very painful [and] horrible.\"But after staying home for a few days as she recovered from the disease, Anna decided to go into work, as she was only receiving partial pay.UK government rules state that while recovering from Covid-19, patients should self-isolate for at least 10 full days. \"I only felt tired and [had] a headache,\" she said. \"That is why I went to work -- I also couldn\\'t afford to stay at home because I received very little salary.\"I feel guilty that I went to work and infected more people, [but] I had no other option.\"An illuminated motorway sign carries the \"Stay At Home\" message, on January 10 in Dunfermline, Scotland.Breaches of self-isolation rules are rampant across the UK. Up to 20,000 people a day are failing to stay home when instructed to, according to Dido Harding, who is in charge of the country\\'s coronavirus Test and Trace scheme. \"These numbers are moving a lot,\" Harding told a parliamentary committee this week, adding that \"circa 20,000 people a day\" were currently not isolating. Harding said she was also concerned about people who were experiencing symptoms but had avoided being tested. For the British government, the lack of compliance is a significant worry.\"My biggest concern is...the people who feel ill but don\\'t come forward for testing at all,\" Harding said. One popular stereotype paints lockdown breakers as young and irreverent people who insist on attending house parties and meeting friends. But experts say the picture is more nuanced. The British public strongly supports lockdown, according to a YouGov poll released in January. Those who are not abiding by the rules often cannot afford to do so.Covid destroyed lives spent together. Now those left behind must say farewell by Zoom\"There\\'s so much emphasis on people not breaking the rules, but the majority are actually following the rules,\" says Muge Cevik, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.Cevik and her colleagues recently published an article in the British Medical Journal urging the government to offer greater support to people self isolating. Their paper points to a successful test-and-care model in San Francisco, which helped people isolate by ensuring home deliveries of goods, among other measures. A similar scheme in New York, which allowed people to opt to isolate in hotels, is also singled out for praise in the article.\"In the majority of hospitalizations what we\\'re seeing is that the majority of infections are among key workers,\" Cevik told CNN. \"We\\'re seeing huge outbreaks in warehouses, meat-packing plants, care homes ... the only thing that combines these sectors are low-paid workers, likely to live in crowded houses.\"In September 2020, the UK government rolled out a new package to support those in self-isolation. Lower income earners having to stay home may be eligible for a payment of £500 if they face losing pay. The penalty for those breaching lockdowns also increased, with those caught now facing  £1,000 ($1,370) fines.\"This new Test and Trace Support payment of £500 will ensure that those on low incomes are able to self-isolate without worry about their finances,\" the UK government said in a statement in September.But the £500 payment comes with stringent requirements -- to be eligible people need to already receive some form of UK government benefit, such as universal credit, working tax credit or housing benefit. Earlier this week, a study published by the Trades Union Congress found that fewer than 40% of applications for the grant were successful. Harding acknowledged during her committee appearance that lack of financial support was one reason that people failed to isolate. Cevik and her colleagues believe more needs to be done, including offering those in crowded homes the chance to self-isolate in separate accommodation, to curb the virus\\' spread.\"If someone has tested positive, [then] at the time of testing, we could be asking them \\'do you have space to isolate? And do you get sick leave?\\'\" she says.\"These [resources] need to come as a package -- income relief, sick leave [and] accommodation is needed.\"Anna says she would \"of course\" have stayed home if she had been given more support.\"I would have stayed home from the first day,\" she told CNN. \"I felt bad, but ... low-wage workers had no choice.\"A digital display at a bus station warns pedestrians of the new strain of coronavirus in central London on January 8.\"I don\\'t blame people who are desperate, and [make that choice to work],\" says Yaseen Aslam, president of the ACDU, a union representing private hire and courier drivers in Britain.\"I know a driver who had to isolate four times in two months, How does that work?\" Aslam told CNN. \"The problem is, drivers are making at the moment £35 or £50 daily,\" he adds. \"The £500 [payment], yeah that\\'s good but the drivers are desperate.\"And when you\\'re in a desperate situation, you take risks. People are choosing between their life and just being out there.\"Uber, among other companies, has piloted a scheme to help protect drivers and passengers by installing partitions in 400 cars, as suggested by government guidelines. The pilot scheme was done in partnership with motoring assistance group, the AA, across Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham, in northern England. But outside the scheme, drivers must decide whether to pay to install the screens. But one driver,\\xa0who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from his employer,\\xa0said he and his peers were not installing the screens as they simply could not afford to.\"This is a pandemic,\" the man, who says he works as a driver in London, said. \"It\\'s not going to last forever -- why should I put that in if it\\'s not going to last forever?\"Aslam also works with the International Alliance of App-Based Transport Workers, an organization that brings together private hire drivers worldwide.\"I work with drivers in France, Amsterdam, San Francisco [and so on,]\" he said. \"We\\'re seeing these problems across the world. But no one is trying to help us.\"2020 through the eyes of Europe\\'s \\'unseen\\' key workersEarly 2021 has been marked across Europe with an outburst of frustration against lockdowns, with protests being held across Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands. The Dutch demonstrations lasted for a few nights in late January and turned violent. Anti-lockdown protesters have also taken to the streets in the UK, most notably in multiple demonstrations in November 2020. Dozens of people have been arrested during the marches, at which some protesters have shared conspiracy theories about Covid-19.\"If people feel vulnerable, then they will comply with lockdown rules,\" Pamela Briggs, a professor of applied psychology at Northumbria University, told CNN. \"For those who feel less vulnerable, then compliance becomes more of a matter of civic duty.\"If you\\'re going to make sacrifices then you have to believe they\\'ll be effective,\" she adds. \"The problem comes when people can\\'t understand why they are being asked to do these things... if people feel the rules don\\'t make sense, they\\'re more likely to challenge them.\"Briggs believes that people need to believe their sacrifice in staying home is worth the personal cost. The UK\\'s three lockdowns have, to various extents, helped to curb rising cases.\"We could make people feel that their sacrifices are genuinely having an effect,\" Briggs said.\"There are ways to demonstrate the efficacy of lockdown and more should be done.\"One year into the Covid crisis, the UK government continues to use lockdowns as a last resort. Some good news awaits on the horizon -- cases are beginning to drop and the country\\'s vaccine rollout has been widely praised.

But the Prime Minister isn\\'t having much luck these days. On Monday night, Irish broadcaster RTE reported what it claimed were details of part of Johnson\\'s plan to break the Brexit deadlock. According to RTE, the UK\\'s plan to avoid post-Brexit infrastructure on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland involve \"customs clearance centers\" several miles from the border -- and on both sides of it. The women of Boris Johnson\\'s past are starting to catch up with himThat, it hopes, will remove the need for something called the Irish border backstop from any final Brexit deal. The backstop is an emergency measure which would keep the two Irish nations in regulatory alignment, removing the need for any border or \"clearance centers\" at all. It\\'s deeply unpopular with many in Johnson\\'s Conservative party and is one of the main reasons his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.Ireland quickly dismissed the idea as a \"non starter\". And Johnson himself told the BBC on Tuesday, \"that\\'s not what we\\'re proposing at all... you\\'ll forgive me, I would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity until we\\'ve been able to share them properly with our friends\". Read MoreSo why is this story a big deal? Keeping the government\\'s formal proposals from Brussels for the time being might be wise. The crunch EU summit, at which any Brexit deal will be struck, is now under three weeks away. JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence vote 02:41The EU is a notoriously tough institution to negotiate with and has a history of tearing apart any Brexit proposal from the moment it leaves the door. Johnson has repeatedly said that the only way to make the EU budge on ditching the backstop is to show that he is both deadly serious about getting a deal but also prepared to leave without one. Some of the ideas reported by RTE chime with speculation about the UK government\\'s plans in recent weeks.  And anyone who has followed Brexit for the last three years will tell you, the EU and Ireland will refuse to sign a deal that involves infrastructure between Ireland and Northern Ireland. So, even though the Prime Minister has distanced himself from the proposals, these headlines will have done little to reassure Brussels that Johnson and his government are serious about getting a deal. It\\'s also a bad look for Johnson back home. He is currently out of London and at his Conservative party\\'s annual conference in Manchester, in the north of England. Johnson will close the conference with a keynote speech on Wednesday afternoon. British politics has been taken over by trollsIt\\'s widely thought that he wanted to trail his final Brexit plan during this speech before formally submitting something to Brussels in the subsequent days. The problem with the leak of any Brexit plan now is that it increases the risk of Johnson being greeted by a hostile audience at his conference on Wednesday. Despite being the Brexit hero of 2016, Conservative hard-Brexiteers are deeply worried that Johnson, if he succeeds in getting rid of the backstop, will simply try and push through the rest May\\'s Brexit deal.For Brexiteers, this would be a huge sellout. There are people sitting in Johnson\\'s cabinet who resigned from Theresa May\\'s government to vote against her Brexit deal. And Johnson himself resigned as May\\'s Foreign Secretary over her general approach to Brexit. Up here in Manchester, the mood among party members is generally positive. Johnson has always been a popular Conservative MP and he seems to have broad support for his hard Brexit language. That could turn sour if he\\'s seen to make concessions to Brussels. Which would all be somewhat ironic, for a man who has spent the past few days accusing his opponents of surrendering.

Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team\\'s name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the \"Eskimos\" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team\\'s long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there\\'s arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn\\'t just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don\\'t have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that\\'s troubling because that\\'s a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples\\' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, \\'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?\\'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples\\' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team\\'s mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club\\'s logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team\\'s logo can cause, but said it would remain the club\\'s logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn\\'t receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples\\' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar\\'s Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club\\'s stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant \\'Indio\\' it\\'s derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club\\'s mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club\\'s website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense\\'s mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn\\'t just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that\\'s very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that\\'s very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won\\'t change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters\\' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as \\'Indios.\\'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile\\'s most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club\\'s badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo\\'s badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn\\'t give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DENNIS BANKS', 'entity_type': 'PERSON',

The hiatus began in March, with Federer already sidelined since he was recuperating from knee surgery. Sunday would have marked the first day of the French Open in its usual spot on the tennis calendar -- in March, though, it was rescheduled for September -- and another grand slam, Wimbledon in July, was called off. \"I\\'m not training at the moment because I don\\'t see a reason for that to be honest,\" Federer told three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten -- who is raising funds for coronavirus relief efforts in his native Brazil -- in a video interview reported by Tennis.com.Read More\"I am happy with my body now and I still believe that the return of the tour\\xa0is a long way off,\" continued the 38-year-old. \"And I think it\\'s important\\xa0mentally to enjoy this break, having played so much tennis.\\xa0\"When I\\'m getting towards returning and have a goal to train for, I think I will be super motivated.\"We should be sliding into @rolandgarros right now, thinking of our mates in Paris 👋 pic.twitter.com/0PLKryyIjj— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) May 24, 2020 Federer is arguably tennis\\' best supported player ever, and the prospect of competing without spectators doesn\\'t appeal to him. \"Most of the time when we are training, there is no one,\" said the men\\'s record 20-time grand slam champion. \"For us, of course, it is possible to play if there are no fans.

Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men\\'s elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that\\'s why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it\\'s also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge\\'s world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year\\'s Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge\\'s record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night\\'s sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It\\'s a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn\\'t sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I\\'ve recovered well ... At this moment, I\\'m really strong. I hope I\\'ll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year\\'s New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele\\'s 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda\\'s Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has \\'the qualities of an ascetic monk\\'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya\\'s Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance\\'s two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city\\'s five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It\\'s more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands\\' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women\\'s race is headlined by Kenya\\'s Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA\\'s Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics.

Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he\\'s grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year\\'s cancellation.\"To see

Her preparation for the year\\'s first major couldn\\'t have gone much better, suggesting the mini grand slam drought for arguably tennis\\' greatest ever player is about to cease. Williams let rip into a punching bag in December -- drawing a compliment from former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, whose daughter happens to be a budding tennis star -- and then won a buildup tournament in Auckland last week to incredibly land a title in a fourth straight decade.

The much bigger prize is the Australian Open, where Williams triumphed while in the early stages of pregnancy in 2017.  If Williams makes the final in Melbourne -- and she might have to defeat the likes of twice grand slam winner Naomi Osaka and current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty along the way -- she will probably have to then defeat someone with a heftier reputation than the 66th-ranked Pegula.

But winning any final -- after losses in grand slam finals to Osaka, Andreescu, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and retiring against Andreescu in the Rogers Cup finale last August -- could potentially be turning point as Williams attempts to draw level with the grand slam haul of Australia\\'s Margaret Court. JUST WATCHEDSerena Williams falls short in major title chaseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSerena Williams falls short in major title chase 01:00\"Serena, she certainly looks hungry, and I think she\\'s got a little momentum going into the Australian Open,\" Chris Evert, the 18-time grand slam champion, told reporters in an ESPN conference call last week. \"And it would probably be the least pressure, this grand slam, to win for her. \"I think every other tournament, the French Open, the clay isn\\'t her best surface. Wimbledon is a lot of pressure, US Open is a lot of pressure. \"This one, the first one of the year, it\\'s a \\'Happy Slam,\\'\" referring to the Australian Open\\'s nickname. \"I think if she just takes a little bit of pressure off herself and she can just play her brand of tennis, I think she\\'s got a good shot at winning it.\"She\\'s better at grand slams than any other player when you look at the last two years.\"The way Wozniacki put it, Williams has a \"big chance\" to match Court. pic.twitter.com/skoZilynH8— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 12, 2020 Other high-profile players, such as Halep and former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova -- who saved four match points last year in Melbourne against Williams and rallied from 5-1 down in the third set after the American rolled her ankle -- aren\\'t discounting her chances, either, despite just falling short recently at grand slams. \"I\\'m very impressed about her, that she keeps playing at this level, with being a mother and also being a little bit older than us,\" said Halep, who made a mere three unforced errors in downing Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final. \"It\\'s impressive what she does.\"Challenges aheadBut Evert also underscored the stiffer challenges facing Williams. \"There are some darned good players out there that I have a lot of respect for, and the way that Osaka, Barty, Pliskova, Halep ... there\\'s not one or two threats to Serena, there\\'s probably about eight threats, eight players that can probably do some damage and that can compete against her.\"And one more thing is -- I always felt this way -- the older you get, I think the more bad days you may have, days when you feel burned out, days when you don\\'t want to get out of bed, days when you don\\'t have incentive.

With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that\\'s why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it\\'s also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge\\'s world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year\\'s Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge\\'s record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night\\'s sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It\\'s a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn\\'t sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I\\'ve recovered well ... At this moment, I\\'m really strong.

Bekele\\'s 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda\\'s Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has \\'the qualities of an ascetic monk\\'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya\\'s Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance\\'s two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city\\'s five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It\\'s more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele.

Mladic had previously referred to the court as \"satanic\" and labeled the charges against him as \"obnoxious.\"ReactionAt a center for the association of women victims of war in Sarajevo, there was an outpouring of emotion during the judge\\'s summation.There was particular frustration that Mladic was acquitted on one charge of genocide in Bosnian municipalities outside of Srebrenica.Amela Meduseljac (L) and Meliha Mrdzic were unhappy that Mladic was acquitted on one charge.Meliha Mrdzic, who said her father and brother were killed and thrown into the Drina River in Visegrad, told CNN she was left humiliated by the decision.\"The international community made me a victim a second time,\" she said. \"They make it seem like we killed ourselves, raped ourselves, slaughtered ourselves.

Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team\\'s name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the \"Eskimos\" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team\\'s long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there\\'s arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn\\'t just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don\\'t have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that\\'s troubling because that\\'s a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples\\' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, \\'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?\\'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples\\' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team\\'s mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club\\'s logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team\\'s logo can cause, but said it would remain the club\\'s logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn\\'t receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples\\' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar\\'s Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club\\'s stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant \\'Indio\\' it\\'s derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club\\'s mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club\\'s website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense\\'s mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn\\'t just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that\\'s very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that\\'s very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won\\'t change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters\\' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as \\'Indios.\\'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile\\'s most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club\\'s badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo\\'s badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn\\'t give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DENNIS BANKS', 'entity_type': 'PERSON',

Bekele, a three-time Olympic gold medalist over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, is the headline name competing in the men\\'s elite field in New York. With his only previous marathon in the United States a fourth-place finish in Chicago seven years ago, the Ethiopian is hungry for success as he prepares to take to the streets of the Big Apple.\"Really, I wanted to have a good result in the USA, that\\'s why I chose the New York marathon,\" Bekele told reporters this week.\"The New York marathon is big publicity and a really big marathon race. To achieve a good result in this marathon would be perfect, and for me, it\\'s also really good to make more history in sports.\"Read MoreBekele has a point to prove after a disappointing outing six weeks ago at the Berlin Marathon -- the race at which he came within two seconds of Eliud Kipchoge\\'s world record time two years ago. Bekele catches his breath after this year\\'s Berlin Marathon. Despite expectations that he could challenge Kipchoge\\'s record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin this year, Bekele says he fell foul to a poor night\\'s sleep as he finished third, more than a minute behind winner Guye Adola.\"I was not ready for that race,\" Bekele explained. \"A few weeks before the race, I was not really confident. It\\'s a little bit tough for me because the day before also I couldn\\'t sleep well, I really had bad luck the day before in the night. That also made me very tired.\"I\\'ve recovered well ... At this moment, I\\'m really strong. I hope I\\'ll achieve a good result on Sunday.\"For race organizers, who called off last year\\'s New York City Marathon amid the pandemic, it is a boon to have a figure like Bekele on the start line on Sunday.On top of his three Olympic gold medals -- including a double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing 2008 -- and one silver medal, he also claimed five world athletics championship titles between 2003 to 2009.  Bekele\\'s 5,000m world record stood for 16 years before it was broken by Uganda\\'s Joshua Cheptegei last year, while his 10,000m record stood for 15 before also being broken last year by Cheptegei. Eliud Kipchoge: Marathon world record holder has \\'the qualities of an ascetic monk\\'Many consider Bekele to be the greatest male distance runner of all time, such has been his supremacy across multiple distances over the past two decades; others point towards Kenya\\'s Kipchoge, who has been so dominant over the 26.2 miles of a marathon and is the first man to break the distance\\'s two-hour barrier, albeit in unofficial conditions. \"I still feel that I am the best and better than anyone,\" Bekele told Sports Illustrated in August after it was announced that he would make his debut in New York. \"I think every athlete and others should think like that.\"Having struggled with injuries and form in recent years, Bekele now has a second opportunity to win a major marathon in the US. There is little chance that he will be able to come close to his best marathon time in New York; unlike Berlin, the course, which undulates through the city\\'s five boroughs, rarely produces fast performances.\"I know the course is tough and there are also no pacemakers in the race. It\\'s more about concentration and a tactical race,\" said Bekele. He will be up against the Netherlands\\' Adbi Nageeye, who won the silver medal at the Olympics in Sapporo three months ago, and the half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie of Kenya, who is making his marathon debut. The women\\'s race is headlined by Kenya\\'s Peres Jepchirchir, the gold medalist at the Olympics. She will be joined by the USA\\'s Olympic bronze medalist Molly Seidel. Seidel poses with her bronze medal from the Tokyo Olympics.

Having already completed marathons in Berlin, London, Chicago, Boston and Portland -- all between times of 2:35:14 and 2:46:39 -- Flanagan will aim to complete her challenge in New York. And as for Bekele, like so many other runners who will take to the start line on Sunday, he\\'s grateful to be able to race in New York following the pandemic and last year\\'s cancellation.\"To see the people of New York participate in this race again -- to see this for me is fantastic,\" he said. \"I want to wish all participants good luck.\"', 'entity_types': ['PERSON', 'ORGANIZATION', 'LOCATION', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'MONEY', 'PERCENTAGE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'LANGUAGE', 'NATIONALITY', 'RELIGION', 'TITLE', 'PROFESSION', 'ANIMAL', 'PLANT', 'DISEASE', 'MEDICATION', 'CHEMICAL', 'MATERIAL', 'COLOR', 'SHAPE', 'MEASUREMENT', 'WEATHER', 'NATURAL_DISASTER', 'AWARD', 'LAW', 'CRIME', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SOFTWARE', 'HARDWARE', 'VEHICLE', 'FOOD', 'DRINK', 'SPORT', 'MUSIC_GENRE', 'INSTRUMENT', 'ARTWORK', 'BOOK', 'MOVIE', 'TV_SHOW', 'ACADEMIC_SUBJECT', 'SCIENTIFIC_THEORY', 'POLITICAL_PARTY', 'CURRENCY', 'STOCK_SYMBOL', 'FILE_TYPE', 'PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE', 'MEDICAL_PROCEDURE', 'CELESTIAL_BODY'], 'reasoning': 'produce the entities_relationships.

Either way, the sport won big in 2021. This year\\'s success starts with a boom in the sport\\'s fanbase that can be pinned to Netflix\\'s \"Drive to Survive\" docuseries. The show is a crash course on the 10 teams, the 20 drivers, the rivalries between them and the race competition structure. A word-of-mouth campaign for the series along with short, easy viewing episodes made it a perfect pandemic-time binge watch for millions around the world.The series\\' intimate interviews combined with the best action from races and the high level drama is a strong pitch for the real-life spectacle of Formula One.The multifaceted storytelling lets fans focus on the aspects of the sport that most appeal to them. And most importantly, \"Drive to Survive\" primed fans for an easy transition to the track when the 2021 season started.Read MoreThe popularity of the Netflix program, notably in the US, has paid dividends. ESPN says its race viewership in 2021 is up 56% over 2020. There was record attendance at the US Grand Prix in Austin this October -- drivers also credit the docuseries for the sport\\'s growth, including Hamilton himself. READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year\\'s constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans\\' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen\\'s car perched on top of Hamilton\\'s after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton\\'s brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen\\'s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\'s at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league\\'s first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.

The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team\\'s long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there\\'s arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn\\'t just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don\\'t have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that\\'s troubling because that\\'s a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples\\' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, \\'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?\\'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples\\' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team\\'s mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club\\'s logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team\\'s logo can cause, but said it would remain the club\\'s logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn\\'t receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples\\' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar\\'s Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club\\'s stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant \\'Indio\\' it\\'s derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club\\'s mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club\\'s website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense\\'s mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn\\'t just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that\\'s very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that\\'s very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won\\'t change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters\\' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as \\'Indios.\\'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile\\'s most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club\\'s badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo\\'s badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn\\'t give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DENNIS BANKS', 'entity_type': 'PERSON',

league is exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or moreThe league helps players lose weight, but it also gives them a built-in support group (CNN)After reviewing restaurants for years, Andrew Shanahan became obese and was looking for a way to lose weight.But it wasn\\'t easy to find a program tailored to men. Every time he tried joining a weight-loss group, he was the only man in the room. \"I wondered how many other men felt that there was something missing and who weren\\'t getting the support that you desperately need when you\\'re trying to lose weight,\" he said.So in 2014, with the help of a crowdfunding campaign, Shanahan launched his Man v Fat initiative to reach out to other men like him. The idea drew attention from celebrities such as chef Jamie Oliver, and Shanahan was encouraged to write a book on it the next year. Being based in England, a soccer league seemed like a natural outreach program. And Shanahan received nearly 1,000 applications for 80 spots in the inaugural league, which was created exclusively for men with a body mass index of 30 or more.Read MorePhotographer Simone PerolariMany of the men used to play soccer -- or as it\\'s called in most of the world, football -- but their weight had become an obstacle in pursuing the sport they love.\"I saw people who want to have fun and slim down and believe in what they do,\" said Simone Perolari, who photographed the league and whose images can be seen in the gallery above. \"There is not a space for them in classic football, but some of them are really good players.\"Rob Bird, 40, read about the league in the Birmingham Mail. He played the sport until he was 25, and he calls the 15 years after that the \"fat years\" when he didn\\'t feel comfortable playing. \"I\\'ve always loved football, but playing against \\'normal-size\\' guys left me feeling like I couldn\\'t compete as they were faster,\" Bird said. \"(This league) is a level playing field for bigger guys.\" Shanahan isn\\'t sure what he was expecting to result from the league\\'s first season, but the competitiveness of the players surprised him. \"For a long time they haven\\'t had a level playing field to compete on, so they are all determined to give it everything they have,\" he said. \"Fortunately, even those teams who lose can see that the benefits of losing weight and getting healthy more than make up for not topping the league.\"Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.Shanahan watched bonds form between the men as they enjoyed their favorite sport and supported one another in their goals to get fit and healthy. After 14 weeks, the 80 team members collectively lost 1,727 pounds, with the average weight loss close to 22 pounds per player. Marcus Farnsworth lost more than 70 pounds and is enjoying the energy boost he\\'s received in return. He hopes it will help with his knees and back as he continues to lose weight. But he also enjoyed the togetherness and support of the guys around him. \"It gives you good motivation if one person is feeling hungry or thinking about snacking,\" Farnsworth said. \"We can give advice and communicate through our WhatsApp group for support.\"Bird has dropped nearly 60 pounds and is now down to 210. His gout and leg ulcer have improved \"immeasurably.\"Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.Rob Bird, a player in the Man v Fat soccer league\"I feel a million times better,\" Bird said. \"This has given me the confidence that if you are making the right choices, you will feel better for it. Being around other guys who struggled with weight fostered a great spirit amongst us of being in it together and sharing our knowledge and experience without any judging or snide comments.\"Shanahan is expanding the league across the rest of the United Kingdom beginning in July, and he hopes to start similar leagues in the United States and other countries. \"We saw a lot of health improvements, whether it was guys curing their sleep apnea, reversing their diabetes or lowering their blood pressure,\" Shanahan said. \"The other really notable thing was how much many of the players grew in confidence. \"I think it\\'s a great thing to undertake a project with other people who desperately want the same thing.

Sunday would have marked the first day of the French Open in its usual spot on the tennis calendar -- in March, though, it was rescheduled for September -- and another grand slam, Wimbledon in July, was called off. \"I\\'m not training at the moment because I don\\'t see a reason for that to be honest,\" Federer told three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten -- who is raising funds for coronavirus relief efforts in his native Brazil -- in a video interview reported by Tennis.com.Read More\"I am happy with my body now and I still believe that the return of the tour\\xa0is a long way off,\" continued the 38-year-old. \"And I think it\\'s important\\xa0mentally to enjoy this break, having played so much tennis.\\xa0\"When I\\'m getting towards returning and have a goal to train for, I think I will be super motivated.\"We should be sliding into @rolandgarros right now, thinking of our mates in Paris 👋 pic.twitter.com/0PLKryyIjj— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) May 24, 2020 Federer is arguably tennis\\' best supported player ever, and the prospect of competing without spectators doesn\\'t appeal to him. \"Most of the time when we are training, there is no one,\" said the men\\'s record 20-time grand slam champion. \"For us, of course, it is possible to play if there are no fans. But on the other hand, I really hope that the circuit can return as it normally is. \"And hold off till the time is appropriate, minimum\\xa0a third of the stadium or half full. But, for me, completely empty when playing big tournaments is very difficult.\"Federer has been active on social media during the lockdown, sparking a public discussion on the merging of the men\\'s and women\\'s tours with a tweet last month and embarking on a funny Instagram Live with tennis rival Rafael Nadal.Nadal, unlike Federer, has started practicing, though only very recently. The Spaniard would have been favored to win a 20th major and tie Federer had the French Open been played as usual given he has collected a record 12 titles at Roland Garros.

Either way, the sport won big in 2021. This year\\'s success starts with a boom in the sport\\'s fanbase that can be pinned to Netflix\\'s \"Drive to Survive\" docuseries. The show is a crash course on the 10 teams, the 20 drivers, the rivalries between them and the race competition structure. A word-of-mouth campaign for the series along with short, easy viewing episodes made it a perfect pandemic-time binge watch for millions around the world.The series\\' intimate interviews combined with the best action from races and the high level drama is a strong pitch for the real-life spectacle of Formula One.The multifaceted storytelling lets fans focus on the aspects of the sport that most appeal to them. And most importantly, \"Drive to Survive\" primed fans for an easy transition to the track when the 2021 season started.Read MoreThe popularity of the Netflix program, notably in the US, has paid dividends. ESPN says its race viewership in 2021 is up 56% over 2020. There was record attendance at the US Grand Prix in Austin this October -- drivers also credit the docuseries for the sport\\'s growth, including Hamilton himself. READ: Title rivals wary of being on collision course in Abu Dhabi showdownMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton have created a thrilling title race. Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year\\'s constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans\\' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen\\'s car perched on top of Hamilton\\'s after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton\\'s brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen\\'s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\'s at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league\\'s first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season. However, it is hard to ignore just how White and male dominated the sport is.JUST WATCHEDValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wire 04:17The FIA, the governing body of the sport, also has some work to do to make rules more transparent and easier to follow. Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.

Anna says she cleans an office building in London which is open but nearly empty, as most staff are working from home. It\\'s a job the Ecuadorean native has done for five years, after moving to the UK from Spain in 2013 while looking for work. CNN is not disclosing Anna\\'s real name as she fears repercussions from her employer. Anna\\'s employer insisted that she continue to clean the building during the pandemic but cut her hours from five a day to four. She earns £10.75 ($14.77) per hour.\"I have been forced to go to work in a nonessential building,\" she told CNN. \"There is no one at work, I\\'m alone.\"Read MoreLast month Anna caught Covid-19. She\\'s unsure where she picked it up from but said it was likely \"on the bus or on the Underground.\" She lives in south London in a shared house and says that at first the virus left her exhausted.The healthcare workers watching from afar as rich countries begin vaccine rollout \"I had a lot of coughs, fever, fatigue... and dizziness,\" she said. \"And I [am taking a long time to recover] because this disease is very painful [and] horrible.\"But after staying home for a few days as she recovered from the disease, Anna decided to go into work, as she was only receiving partial pay.UK government rules state that while recovering from Covid-19, patients should self-isolate for at least 10 full days. \"I only felt tired and [had] a headache,\" she said. \"That is why I went to work -- I also couldn\\'t afford to stay at home because I received very little salary.\"I feel guilty that I went to work and infected more people, [but] I had no other option.\"An illuminated motorway sign carries the \"Stay At Home\" message, on January 10 in Dunfermline, Scotland.Breaches of self-isolation rules are rampant across the UK. Up to 20,000 people a day are failing to stay home when instructed to, according to Dido Harding, who is in charge of the country\\'s coronavirus Test and Trace scheme. \"These numbers are moving a lot,\" Harding told a parliamentary committee this week, adding that \"circa 20,000 people a day\" were currently not isolating. Harding said she was also concerned about people who were experiencing symptoms but had avoided being tested. For the British government, the lack of compliance is a significant worry.\"My biggest concern is...the people who feel ill but don\\'t come forward for testing at all,\" Harding said. One popular stereotype paints lockdown breakers as young and irreverent people who insist on attending house parties and meeting friends. But experts say the picture is more nuanced. The British public strongly supports lockdown, according to a YouGov poll released in January. Those who are not abiding by the rules often cannot afford to do so.Covid destroyed lives spent together. Now those left behind must say farewell by Zoom\"There\\'s so much emphasis on people not breaking the rules, but the majority are actually following the rules,\" says Muge Cevik, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.Cevik and her colleagues recently published an article in the British Medical Journal urging the government to offer greater support to people self isolating. Their paper points to a successful test-and-care model in San Francisco, which helped people isolate by ensuring home deliveries of goods, among other measures. A similar scheme in New York, which allowed people to opt to isolate in hotels, is also singled out for praise in the article.\"In the majority of hospitalizations what we\\'re seeing is that the majority of infections are among key workers,\" Cevik told CNN. \"We\\'re seeing huge outbreaks in warehouses, meat-packing plants, care homes ... the only thing that combines these sectors are low-paid workers, likely to live in crowded houses.\"In September 2020, the UK government rolled out a new package to support those in self-isolation. Lower income earners having to stay home may be eligible for a payment of £500 if they face losing pay. The penalty for those breaching lockdowns also increased, with those caught now facing  £1,000 ($1,370) fines.\"This new Test and Trace Support payment of £500 will ensure that those on low incomes are able to self-isolate without worry about their finances,\" the UK government said in a statement in September.But the £500 payment comes with stringent requirements -- to be eligible people need to already receive some form of UK government benefit, such as universal credit, working tax credit or housing benefit. Earlier this week, a study published by the Trades Union Congress found that fewer than 40% of applications for the grant were successful. Harding acknowledged during her committee appearance that lack of financial support was one reason that people failed to isolate. Cevik and her colleagues believe more needs to be done, including offering those in crowded homes the chance to self-isolate in separate accommodation, to curb the virus\\' spread.\"If someone has tested positive, [then] at the time of testing, we could be asking them \\'do you have space to isolate? And do you get sick leave?\\'\" she says.\"These [resources] need to come as a package -- income relief, sick leave [and] accommodation is needed.\"Anna says she would \"of course\" have stayed home if she had been given more support.\"I would have stayed home from the first day,\" she told CNN. \"I felt bad, but ... low-wage workers had no choice.\"A digital display at a bus station warns pedestrians of the new strain of coronavirus in central London on January 8.\"I don\\'t blame people who are desperate, and [make that choice to work],\" says Yaseen Aslam, president of the ACDU, a union representing private hire and courier drivers in Britain.\"I know a driver who had to isolate four times in two months, How does that work?\" Aslam told CNN. \"The problem is, drivers are making at the moment £35 or £50 daily,\" he adds. \"The £500 [payment], yeah that\\'s good but the drivers are desperate.\"And when you\\'re in a desperate situation, you take risks. People are choosing between their life and just being out there.\"Uber, among other companies, has piloted a scheme to help protect drivers and passengers by installing partitions in 400 cars, as suggested by government guidelines. The pilot scheme was done in partnership with motoring assistance group, the AA, across Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham, in northern England. But outside the scheme, drivers must decide whether to pay to install the screens. But one driver,\\xa0who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from his employer,\\xa0said he and his peers were not installing the screens as they simply could not afford to.\"This is a pandemic,\" the man, who says he works as a driver in London, said. \"It\\'s not going to last forever -- why should I put that in if it\\'s not going to last forever?\"Aslam also works with the International Alliance of App-Based Transport Workers, an organization that brings together private hire drivers worldwide.\"I work with drivers in France, Amsterdam, San Francisco [and so on,]\" he said. \"We\\'re seeing these problems across the world. But no one is trying to help us.\"2020 through the eyes of Europe\\'s \\'unseen\\' key workersEarly 2021 has been marked across Europe with an outburst of frustration against lockdowns, with protests being held across Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands. The Dutch demonstrations lasted for a few nights in late January and turned violent. Anti-lockdown protesters have also taken to the streets in the UK, most notably in multiple demonstrations in November 2020. Dozens of people have been arrested during the marches, at which some protesters have shared conspiracy theories about Covid-19.\"If people feel vulnerable, then they will comply with lockdown rules,\" Pamela Briggs, a professor of applied psychology at Northumbria University, told CNN. \"For those who feel less vulnerable, then compliance becomes more of a matter of civic duty.\"If you\\'re going to make sacrifices then you have to believe they\\'ll be effective,\" she adds. \"The problem comes when people can\\'t understand why they are being asked to do these things... if people feel the rules don\\'t make sense, they\\'re more likely to challenge them.\"Briggs believes that people need to believe their sacrifice in staying home is worth the personal cost. The UK\\'s three lockdowns have, to various extents, helped to curb rising cases.\"We could make people feel that their sacrifices are genuinely having an effect,\" Briggs said.\"There are ways to demonstrate the efficacy of lockdown and more should be done.\"One year into the Covid crisis, the UK government continues to use lockdowns as a last resort. Some good news awaits on the horizon -- cases are beginning to drop and the country\\'s vaccine rollout has been widely praised.

Made by Siemens as a black Bakelite phone, it was later painted red and engraved with Hitler\\'s name and a swastika, the catalog says.The auction house describes the telephone as \"Hitler\\'s mobile device of destruction\" and called it \"arguably the most destructive \\'weapon\\' of all time, which sent millions to their deaths around the world.\"Hitler\\'s name is engraved on the back of the phone, along with an eagle and swastika.Read MoreBritish officer Ralph Rayner recovered the phone from Hitler\\'s bunker while visiting Berlin on the orders of Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery just a few days after the end of the war, according to Rayner\\'s personal account and shipping documents from that time period, according to the auction house.

After scrapping the plan to slash $4 billion in foreign aid, Trump said his team would look to find cuts elsewhere in the aid budget.\"The President has made no secret when it comes to foreign assistance that US interests abroad should be prioritized and other foreign countries should also be paying their fair share,\" a senior administration official told CNN.Specifically, Trump has directed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and national security adviser John Bolton to oversee the process, the senior administration official said. The President has not yet made a final decision on whether to permanently block the funds, an administration official told CNN. The review process, however, has effectively paused disbursement of the funds, which are set to expire on September 30 if they are not used.Read MoreJames Mattis: \\'I had no choice but to leave\\' the Trump administrationThe Pentagon has already recommended to the White House that the hold on military assistance to Ukraine be lifted, an administration official and a US defense official told CNN Thursday. A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.\"We do not publicly comment on internal budget deliberations. For further inquiries, I direct you to the White House Office of Management and Budget,\" said spokesperson Lt. Col. Carla Gleason.However the hold on the aid remains in place, as it is the White House\\'s call whether to lift it, the administration official said, fueling uncertainty within the administration about what will happen to the spending after the review is formally completed.In the meantime, agencies are authorized and encouraged to execute all processes to prepare for the obligation of those funds but must wait to obligate them until the policy review is complete and the President has made a final determination, the senior official said. Bipartisan angerIf Trump ultimately decides to block the aid package, a possibility first reported by Politico, it would likely prompt a bipartisan uproar from members of Congress who believe US military support is essential to countering Russia\\'s military involvement in Ukraine.Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voiced his strong opposition to that idea in a tweet Thursday: \"This is unacceptable. It was wrong when Obama failed to stand up to Putin in Ukraine, and it\\'s wrong now.\"Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez released a statement accusing the administration of circumventing Congress and \"undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support.\"\"In willfully delaying these funds, the Trump Administration is once again trying to circumvent Congress\\' Constitutional prerogative of appropriating funds for U.S. government agencies.

A US Department of State official told CNN on Thursday that the policy on Ukraine has not changed, adding the US remains committed to a robust partnership between the two countries. But Trump\\'s public deference to Putin and Russia has alarmed US allies and lawmakers. The issue has only been amplified by Trump\\'s recent comments at the G7 summit, in which he seemingly downplayed Russia\\'s military incursion in Ukraine and suggested that Russia be reinstated into the group of leading global economies.The US has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in security assistance since 2014 as it has sought to bolster the country\\'s military, which is facing an ongoing conflict with separatists in the country\\'s east, forces the Pentagon believes are backed, armed and even led by Moscow.In 2017, the Trump administration announced its decision to provide lethal anti-tank weapons, including US-made Javelin missiles, to Ukraine. \"Since 2014, there has been broad bipartisan support in the Senate for security assistance to Ukraine.

Yermak was appointed as an aide to Zelensky in May, according to local media reports.The two spoke twice over the phone, with Yermak offering to come to the US to meet with Giuliani before the two agreed to meet in Madrid last month, Giuliani said.Giuliani claims that Yermak asked him questions and that he didn\\'t ask the Ukrainian lawyer to do anything because he \"didn\\'t need to.\" The focus of their conversation was on Biden\\'s possible role as then-vice president in the prosecutor\\'s dismissal and how Ukraine may have tried to damage Trump\\'s campaign, Giuliani said.The State Department confirmed last week that it had assisted in connecting Yermak and Giuliani.CNN\\'s Ryan Browne, Michael Warren and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'President of the United States, considering a plan to block military assistance to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 1.0}, {'entity_name': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'President of Russia, with whom Trump seeks to ingratiate himself.', 'importance_score': 0.9}, {'entity_name': 'UKRAINE', 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'description': 'Country receiving military assistance from the US, which Trump is considering blocking.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'MARK ESPER', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'Defense Secretary overseeing the review of the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'JOHN BOLTON', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'National security adviser involved in the review process.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'PENTAGON', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'US Department recommending the lifting of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 0.6}, {'entity_name': 'WHITE HOUSE', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'Administration making the final decision on the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'CONGRESS', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'Legislative body expressing bipartisan opposition to blocking the aid package.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'ADAM KINZINGER', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'Republican Representative opposing the blocking of aid to Ukraine.', 'importance_score': 0.6}, {'entity_name': 'BOB MENENDEZ', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"Democratic Senator criticizing the administration's handling of the aid package.\", 'importance_score': 0.6}], 'relationships': [{'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'UKRAINE', 'description': 'Trump is considering blocking military assistance to Ukraine.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN', 'description': \"Trump's decision to block aid to Ukraine would ingratiate him with Putin.\", 'weight': 0.8, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'MARK ESPER', 'description': 'Trump has directed Esper to oversee the review of the aid package.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'tgt_id': 'JOHN BOLTON', 'description': 'Trump has directed Bolton to oversee the review process.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'PENTAGON', 'tgt_id': 'WHITE HOUSE', 'description': 'The Pentagon has recommended to the White House that the hold on military assistance to Ukraine be lifted.', 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'CONGRESS', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Congress is expressing bipartisan opposition to Trump's decision to block the aid package.\", 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'ADAM KINZINGER', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Kinzinger opposes Trump's idea of blocking aid to Ukraine.\", 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 2}, {'src_id': 'BOB MENENDEZ', 'tgt_id': 'DONALD TRUMP', 'description': \"Menendez criticizes the administration's handling of the aid package.\", 'weight': 0.6, 'order': 2}]}) (input_keys={'input_text'})], [Example({'augmented': True, 'input_text': 'London (CNN)Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is being treated for an infection and is not expected to leave the hospital for several days, according to an update from Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.\"The Duke of Edinburgh remains at King Edward VII\\'s Hospital where he is receiving medical attention for an infection.

It mainly covers a terrain of forest trails and open fields, but also traverses roads, towns and farms, taking in some breathtaking scenery.The Trail would take hikers about six months to complete in its entirety, but Meltzer\\'s record took just a quarter of that, though his record attempt has been nearly a decade in the making.\"I\\'ve been trying to do it for nine years and the Appalachian Trail has been one of my favorite trails ever to run on,\" he told CNN. \"Now, after trying three times, I finally get the chance to say I\\'m the king of the AT.\" The previous record of 46 days, eight hours and seven minutes was held by Scott Jurek, a friend, training partner, and rival of Meltzer. Jurek ran his record from south to north, the opposite way to his counterpart. \"It was great to beat Scott Jurek\\'s record, too,\" said Meltzer, \"and to have him there at the end to run with me. It was really an honor and inspiration. Now it\\'s my turn to hand over the baton to someone else.\"\\'A long journey of misery\\': Ultrarunners -- a rare breed After one and a half months of four o\\'clock starts in the morning in order to run 50 miles, Meltzer\\'s feat was grueling and, in his own words, miserable.But the 48-year-old is by no means alone in his quest to carry his body over immense distances.An ultramarathon refers to any race longer than 42.195 km (26.219 miles), the length of a regular marathon. They can take place over a succession of days, or simply involve a single race, usually measuring between 50 and 200 km.Competitors at the Marathon des Sables in MoroccoThese races are often made worse by punishing conditions overhead and underfoot. The Marathon des Sables (MDS), for example, is a six-day, 251-km race across the Sahara Desert. Not only is the soft sand notoriously difficult to run on, but temperatures also often exceed 120°F (50°C). It\\'s not for the fainthearted. Blisters can develop from the smallest grain of sand getting in your shoes, and feet can swell from the heat. There are also more long-term problems: research has suggested that running such extreme distances may cause damage to heart tissue.Read: How to survive a desert marathonThe Badwater Ultramarathon vies with the MDS for the title of the world\\'s toughest footrace. The 135-mile course in California\\'s Death Valley reaches temperatures similar to those in the Sahara. Contestants are often seen wearing full body white suits as protection from UV light. It is estimated that 20-40% of runners on the start line fail to reach the finish.A lonely runner at BadwaterThen there\\'s the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run in Colorado that covers 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of elevation 13 times. The quickest time is a mere 22 hours 41 minutes. Meltzer has won this race five times -- more than any other man (Betsy Kalmeyer has the most female wins, also with five.) He\\'s completed 89 ultramarathons in his career and has won 38 100-mile races -- again, more than any other man -- having racked up six wins at the Wastach 100 and five at the Squaw Peak 50.But despite his breathtaking stamina, Meltzer is still human, snacking on candy, and ended each day on the Trail with a cold beer. Record broken, he now intends to catch up on sleep and play some golf.But of course he\\'s got a world record for that, too, having played the most holes ever (230) in 12 hours.

Russia has been building up forces and equipment near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending troops into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a \"full-fledged theater of operations\" from which to launch an attack.US intelligence officials have said they don\\'t know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to do so, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia\\'s western flank.Read MoreUkrainian soldiers in a front line trench near pro-Russian separatists take shelter from the extreme cold. After high-level talks between Moscow and Washington wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on Ukraine\\'s border, prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy have been cast into doubt. Now the Biden administration is weighing whether to deploy as many as 5,000 US troops, according to a senior defense official, to shore up NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics.  On Monday, both NATO and Russia pointed the finger at each other for the ratcheting tensions. \"Tensions are escalating due to concrete actions taken by the US and NATO,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to NATO\\'s announcement.\"I mean the informational hysteria that we are witnessing -- it is generously framed by a huge amount of false information, just lies and fakes,\" Peskov added.Biden administration identifying troops for possible deployment to Eastern Europe amid Russia tensionsNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Monday statement that the alliance would continue to take necessary measures \"to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance.\" He added: \"We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.\"The NATO statement said that in recent days, a flurry of member states had announced deployments to the region. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania, the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria, France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. Stoltenberg cautioned in a news conference on Monday that the moves were defensive and proportionate -- and that NATO was \"not threatening Russia.\" There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. NATO, Europe and the US have been united in their opposition to any further Russian incursion in Ukraine, promising to lend support to Ukraine and hand down \"massive costs\" for Moscow in the event they make a move. But the shape of that response and what steps they might take are still unclear.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday warned that \"a single additional Russian force\" entering Ukraine \"in an aggressive way\" would result in a severe response by the US and its allies. His comments came after US President Joe Biden muddled the message of severe consequences last week, saying at a news conference that a \"minor incursion\" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. The President later clarified that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine\\'s border would constitute an invasion.CNN reported last week that the US military goal would be to \"meet the capability\" NATO allies in the region are asking for, a defense official said. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that as many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened preparedness to deploy.Local residents Marinka, Ukraine, walk past an apartment building destroyed during fighting in 2015 between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed separatists. Fighting is still ongoing.The mobilization of Western forces comes amid a significant uptick in Russia\\'s military movements, not only on Ukraine\\'s border -- where the Ukrainian Defense Ministry says there are now 127,000 Russian troops stationed -- but elsewhere in Europe. The Russian Defense Ministry announced last week that 140 ships and 10,000 servicemen would take part in sweeping exercises from the Pacific to the Atlantic, including off Ireland\\'s southwest coast in February. The ministry said the main purpose of the drills is to protect Russia\\'s national interests in the world\\'s oceans, TASS state news agency reported.In Ukraine, one question looms: What will we do if Russia attacks? Ireland\\'s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told reporters on Monday that he had raised concerns with Moscow about Russia\\'s plans. \"This isn\\'t the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what\\'s happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,\" Coveney said. Coveney and other European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the security situation in Ukraine and what action to take should Russia cross into Ukrainian territory; Blinken joined by video link following talks with Lavrov in Geneva. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the \"most comprehensive\" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said.But while NATO countries ramp up readiness and the EU discusses heightened security concerns, Ukraine\\'s own government has not, at least outwardly, signaled the same sense of urgency. In a call with the President of the European Council Charles Michel on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country will not succumb to provocations, but would \"keep calm.\" Zelensky and his government have previously downplayed the danger of a Russian invasion, noting that the threat has existed for years and has not become greater in recent months. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been rumbling since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine\\'s east. Despite a cease fire in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace.Tensions are high on Ukraine\\'s border with Russia. Here\\'s what you need to knowUkraine on Monday criticized the US\\' decision to withdraw diplomats\\' families and reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, with Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, saying in a tweet: \"We believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution.\" But other countries are also taking precautions in Kyiv, Ukraine\\'s capital. The UK Foreign Office also announced Monday that some British Embassy staff and dependents were being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to \"growing threats from Russia.\" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that the intelligence around the situation in Ukraine was \"gloomy\" but that war was not inevitable.Speaking to reporters at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, the bloc\\'s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Europe will seek to simmer tensions between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy first but warned Moscow it is prepared to take action if necessary. He also urged for calm, stressing the need to avoid \"alarmist reactions that could that could lead to an escalation. We don\\'t want people to have a breakdown on this.\"  Borrell added that the EU had no current plans to evacuate diplomatic staff and their families from Ukraine.Eliza Mackintosh wrote and reported in London.

Title race enthralls New fans are important but getting them to stick with the sport is critical. This year\\'s constant action on the track anchored by the Hamilton-Verstappen title fight has satisfied the second part of that equation. Eyes across the globe will be on all 58 laps in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the final race to determine who takes home the title. Up until the last lap, every second of the season has been and will be a nail biter.All the variables that brought the two drivers to tally the same exact score heading into the finale is what kept fans\\' attention throughout the season. Think Verstappen\\'s car perched on top of Hamilton\\'s after the crash in Monza or the smoke rising forebodingly from Hamilton\\'s brakes seconds before the restart in Baku. Verstappen\\'s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\'s at the Italian Grand Prix in September.The best racing is when the two are at it, wheel-to-wheel, like they were through the opening laps of the British Grand Prix.Sprint Qualifying, a format introduced to three weekends this season was seen across the community as a controversial addition to the sport. Despite that, it provided something new for fans who welcomed the extra racing.F1 still has improvements to make on several fronts that would make the sport and viewing experience more inclusive.There is still an obvious need for greater diversity behind the wheel and in the institution itself. The league\\'s first full-time driver from China, Guanyu Zhou, will be a much-welcomed addition to the track when he makes his debut next season.

Commentators do their best to make sense of the calls being made by the stewards, but sometimes, even they are left scratching their heads -- driver and team penalties often seem totally arbitrary or ill-explained.Fan accessibility will remain a challenge. Part of that is built-in because F1 is a global sport with just over 20 events a year. Those constraints make attending a race weekend expensive. For American fans eager to make it to a race, there is some good news: a race in Miami next season means two races in the US for the first time since 1984.After the exciting culmination of this season comes the anticipation for the next, with new car designs and some changes in the driver lineup. Season four of \"Drive to Survive\" is imminent too. All of that adds up to a feeling that there is so much more to come from the sport.

Example({'input_text': 'London (CNN)Anna says she did not want to break the UK\\'s Covid-19 lockdown rules.The 37-year-old has worked through the pandemic. Anna says she cleans an office building in London which is open but nearly empty, as most staff are working from home. It\\'s a job the Ecuadorean native has done for five years, after moving to the UK from Spain in 2013 while looking for work. CNN is not disclosing Anna\\'s real name as she fears repercussions from her employer. Anna\\'s employer insisted that she continue to clean the building during the pandemic but cut her hours from five a day to four. She earns £10.75 ($14.77) per hour.\"I have been forced to go to work in a nonessential building,\" she told CNN. \"There is no one at work, I\\'m alone.\"Read MoreLast month Anna caught Covid-19. She\\'s unsure where she picked it up from but said it was likely \"on the bus or on the Underground.\" She lives in south London in a shared house and says that at first the virus left her exhausted.The healthcare workers watching from afar as rich countries begin vaccine rollout \"I had a lot of coughs, fever, fatigue... and dizziness,\" she said. \"And I [am taking a long time to recover] because this disease is very painful [and] horrible.\"But after staying home for a few days as she recovered from the disease, Anna decided to go into work, as she was only receiving partial pay.UK government rules state that while recovering from Covid-19, patients should self-isolate for at least 10 full days. \"I only felt tired and [had] a headache,\" she said. \"That is why I went to work -- I also couldn\\'t afford to stay at home because I received very little salary.\"I feel guilty that I went to work and infected more people, [but] I had no other option.\"An illuminated motorway sign carries the \"Stay At Home\" message, on January 10 in Dunfermline, Scotland.Breaches of self-isolation rules are rampant across the UK. Up to 20,000 people a day are failing to stay home when instructed to, according to Dido Harding, who is in charge of the country\\'s coronavirus Test and Trace scheme. \"These numbers are moving a lot,\" Harding told a parliamentary committee this week, adding that \"circa 20,000 people a day\" were currently not isolating. Harding said she was also concerned about people who were experiencing symptoms but had avoided being tested. For the British government, the lack of compliance is a significant worry.\"My biggest concern is...the people who feel ill but don\\'t come forward for testing at all,\" Harding said. One popular stereotype paints lockdown breakers as young and irreverent people who insist on attending house parties and meeting friends. But experts say the picture is more nuanced. The British public strongly supports lockdown, according to a YouGov poll released in January. Those who are not abiding by the rules often cannot afford to do so.Covid destroyed lives spent together. Now those left behind must say farewell by Zoom\"There\\'s so much emphasis on people not breaking the rules, but the majority are actually following the rules,\" says Muge Cevik, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.Cevik and her colleagues recently published an article in the British Medical Journal urging the government to offer greater support to people self isolating. Their paper points to a successful test-and-care model in San Francisco, which helped people isolate by ensuring home deliveries of goods, among other measures. A similar scheme in New York, which allowed people to opt to isolate in hotels, is also singled out for praise in the article.\"In the majority of hospitalizations what we\\'re seeing is that the majority of infections are among key workers,\" Cevik told CNN. \"We\\'re seeing huge outbreaks in warehouses, meat-packing plants, care homes ... the only thing that combines these sectors are low-paid workers, likely to live in crowded houses.\"In September 2020, the UK government rolled out a new package to support those in self-isolation. Lower income earners having to stay home may be eligible for a payment of £500 if they face losing pay. The penalty for those breaching lockdowns also increased, with those caught now facing  £1,000 ($1,370) fines.\"This new Test and Trace Support payment of £500 will ensure that those on low incomes are able to self-isolate without worry about their finances,\" the UK government said in a statement in September.But the £500 payment comes with stringent requirements -- to be eligible people need to already receive some form of UK government benefit, such as universal credit, working tax credit or housing benefit. Earlier this week, a study published by the Trades Union Congress found that fewer than 40% of applications for the grant were successful. Harding acknowledged during her committee appearance that lack of financial support was one reason that people failed to isolate. Cevik and her colleagues believe more needs to be done, including offering those in crowded homes the chance to self-isolate in separate accommodation, to curb the virus\\' spread.\"If someone has tested positive, [then] at the time of testing, we could be asking them \\'do you have space to isolate? And do you get sick leave?\\'\" she says.\"These [resources] need to come as a package -- income relief, sick leave [and] accommodation is needed.\"Anna says she would \"of course\" have stayed home if she had been given more support.\"I would have stayed home from the first day,\" she told CNN. \"I felt bad, but ... low-wage workers had no choice.\"A digital display at a bus station warns pedestrians of the new strain of coronavirus in central London on January 8.\"I don\\'t blame people who are desperate, and [make that choice to work],\" says Yaseen Aslam, president of the ACDU, a union representing private hire and courier drivers in Britain.\"I know a driver who had to isolate four times in two months, How does that work?\" Aslam told CNN. \"The problem is, drivers are making at the moment £35 or £50 daily,\" he adds. \"The £500 [payment], yeah that\\'s good but the drivers are desperate.\"And when you\\'re in a desperate situation, you take risks. People are choosing between their life and just being out there.\"Uber, among other companies, has piloted a scheme to help protect drivers and passengers by installing partitions in 400 cars, as suggested by government guidelines. The pilot scheme was done in partnership with motoring assistance group, the AA, across Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham, in northern England. But outside the scheme, drivers must decide whether to pay to install the screens. But one driver,\\xa0who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from his employer,\\xa0said he and his peers were not installing the screens as they simply could not afford to.\"This is a pandemic,\" the man, who says he works as a driver in London, said. \"It\\'s not going to last forever -- why should I put that in if it\\'s not going to last forever?\"Aslam also works with the International Alliance of App-Based Transport Workers, an organization that brings together private hire drivers worldwide.\"I work with drivers in France, Amsterdam, San Francisco [and so on,]\" he said. \"We\\'re seeing these problems across the world. But no one is trying to help us.\"2020 through the eyes of Europe\\'s \\'unseen\\' key workersEarly 2021 has been marked across Europe with an outburst of frustration against lockdowns, with protests being held across Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands. The Dutch demonstrations lasted for a few nights in late January and turned violent. Anti-lockdown protesters have also taken to the streets in the UK, most notably in multiple demonstrations in November 2020. Dozens of people have been arrested during the marches, at which some protesters have shared conspiracy theories about Covid-19.\"If people feel vulnerable, then they will comply with lockdown rules,\" Pamela Briggs, a professor of applied psychology at Northumbria University, told CNN. \"For those who feel less vulnerable, then compliance becomes more of a matter of civic duty.\"If you\\'re going to make sacrifices then you have to believe they\\'ll be effective,\" she adds. \"The problem comes when people can\\'t understand why they are being asked to do these things... if people feel the rules don\\'t make sense, they\\'re more likely to challenge them.\"Briggs believes that people need to believe their sacrifice in staying home is worth the personal cost. The UK\\'s three lockdowns have, to various extents, helped to curb rising cases.\"We could make people feel that their sacrifices are genuinely having an effect,\" Briggs said.\"There are ways to demonstrate the efficacy of lockdown and more should be done.\"One year into the Covid crisis, the UK government continues to use lockdowns as a last resort.

the first for Van Dijk\\'s foul on David de Gea and the second for a fractional offside decision.Liverpool was cruising at half time, though if any particularly jittery fans did need some extra comforting, the Reds hadn\\'t lost a home Premier League game when leading at the interval for 10 years, a run stretching back 102 matches.Two minutes into the second half, Salah had one of the easiest chances he\\'ll ever have to score but somehow fluffed his shot from three yards out wide of the post.It was a let off for Manchester United -- whose players looked to have started the second period half asleep -- and just seconds later some sloppy play at the back gifted the ball to Jordan Henderson, who crashed an effort off the outside of the post.Those missed opportunities seemed to spark life into United and Anthony Martial squandered his side\\'s only real chance of the match, blazing his shot wildly over the bar when it looked easier to score.Mo Salah celebrates after scoring Liverpool\\'s second.With the visiting side throwing all its men forward in search of a later equalizer, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson hit a stunning pass upfield to find Salah completely unmarked.United winger Daniel James did well to get back but the Egyptian held off his challenge and coolly slotted the ball under De Gea to send Anfield into rapture.\"And now you\\'re gonna believe us,\" the fans continued. \"We\\'re going to win the league.\"', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'LIVERPOOL', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'A football club that has not won the league title for 30 years and is currently leading the table with a 16-point advantage.', 'importance_score': 1.0}, {'entity_name': 'MANCHESTER UNITED', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': \"A football club that faced Liverpool in a match where they lost 2-0, extending Liverpool's lead in the table.\", 'importance_score': 0.9}, {'entity_name': 'MO SALAH', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"A football player who scored the second goal in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Manchester United.\", 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'VIRGIL VAN DIJK', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"A football player who scored the first goal in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Manchester United.\", 'importance_score': 0.8}, {'entity_name': 'JURGEN KLOPP', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'The manager of Liverpool football club.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'PEP GUARDIOLA', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': 'The manager of Manchester City football club.', 'importance_score': 0.7}, {'entity_name': 'ANFIELD', 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'description': 'The stadium where the match between Liverpool and Manchester United took place.', 'importance_score': 0.6}], 'relationships': [{'src_id': 'LIVERPOOL', 'tgt_id': 'MANCHESTER UNITED', 'description': 'Liverpool defeated Manchester United 2-0 in a Premier League match.', 'weight': 1.0, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'MO SALAH', 'tgt_id': 'LIVERPOOL', 'description': 'Mo Salah scored the second goal for Liverpool in their match against Manchester United.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'VIRGIL VAN DIJK', 'tgt_id': 'LIVERPOOL', 'description': 'Virgil van Dijk scored the first goal for Liverpool in their match against Manchester United.', 'weight': 0.9, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'JURGEN KLOPP', 'tgt_id': 'LIVERPOOL', 'description': 'Jurgen Klopp is the manager of Liverpool football club.', 'weight': 0.8, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'PEP GUARDIOLA', 'tgt_id': 'MANCHESTER CITY', 'description': 'Pep Guardiola is the manager of Manchester City football club.', 'weight': 0.8, 'order': 1}, {'src_id': 'ANFIELD', 'tgt_id': 'LIVERPOOL', 'description': 'Anfield is the home stadium of Liverpool football club.', 'weight': 0.7, 'order': 1}]}) (input_keys={'input_text'})], [Example({'augmented': True, 'input_text': ' (CNN)A ban on cellphones in classrooms was announced in the Australian state of Victoria on Wednesday.

The Australian Education Union Victoria said in a statement that while it supports the ban: \"We can\\'t lose sight of the benefits that technology, including mobile phones, can bring to high quality teaching and learning.\"Some pupils with special needs will be exempt from the ban, including those who require telephones to monitor health conditions or those who have received permission from a teacher.

But the Prime Minister isn\\'t having much luck these days. On Monday night, Irish broadcaster RTE reported what it claimed were details of part of Johnson\\'s plan to break the Brexit deadlock. According to RTE, the UK\\'s plan to avoid post-Brexit infrastructure on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland involve \"customs clearance centers\" several miles from the border -- and on both sides of it. The women of Boris Johnson\\'s past are starting to catch up with himThat, it hopes, will remove the need for something called the Irish border backstop from any final Brexit deal. The backstop is an emergency measure which would keep the two Irish nations in regulatory alignment, removing the need for any border or \"clearance centers\" at all. It\\'s deeply unpopular with many in Johnson\\'s Conservative party and is one of the main reasons his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament.Ireland quickly dismissed the idea as a \"non starter\". And Johnson himself told the BBC on Tuesday, \"that\\'s not what we\\'re proposing at all... you\\'ll forgive me, I would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity until we\\'ve been able to share them properly with our friends\". Read MoreSo why is this story a big deal? Keeping the government\\'s formal proposals from Brussels for the time being might be wise. The crunch EU summit, at which any Brexit deal will be struck, is now under three weeks away. JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence vote 02:41The EU is a notoriously tough institution to negotiate with and has a history of tearing apart any Brexit proposal from the moment it leaves the door. Johnson has repeatedly said that the only way to make the EU budge on ditching the backstop is to show that he is both deadly serious about getting a deal but also prepared to leave without one. Some of the ideas reported by RTE chime with speculation about the UK government\\'s plans in recent weeks.  And anyone who has followed Brexit for the last three years will tell you, the EU and Ireland will refuse to sign a deal that involves infrastructure between Ireland and Northern Ireland. So, even though the Prime Minister has distanced himself from the proposals, these headlines will have done little to reassure Brussels that Johnson and his government are serious about getting a deal. It\\'s also a bad look for Johnson back home. He is currently out of London and at his Conservative party\\'s annual conference in Manchester, in the north of England. Johnson will close the conference with a keynote speech on Wednesday afternoon. British politics has been taken over by trollsIt\\'s widely thought that he wanted to trail his final Brexit plan during this speech before formally submitting something to Brussels in the subsequent days. The problem with the leak of any Brexit plan now is that it increases the risk of Johnson being greeted by a hostile audience at his conference on Wednesday. Despite being the Brexit hero of 2016, Conservative hard-Brexiteers are deeply worried that Johnson, if he succeeds in getting rid of the backstop, will simply try and push through the rest May\\'s Brexit deal.For Brexiteers, this would be a huge sellout. There are people sitting in Johnson\\'s cabinet who resigned from Theresa May\\'s government to vote against her Brexit deal. And Johnson himself resigned as May\\'s Foreign Secretary over her general approach to Brexit. Up here in Manchester, the mood among party members is generally positive. Johnson has always been a popular Conservative MP and he seems to have broad support for his hard Brexit language. That could turn sour if he\\'s seen to make concessions to Brussels. Which would all be somewhat ironic, for a man who has spent the past few days accusing his opponents of surrendering.

Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team\\'s name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the \"Eskimos\" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team\\'s long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there\\'s arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn\\'t just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don\\'t have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that\\'s troubling because that\\'s a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples\\' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, \\'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?\\'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples\\' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team\\'s mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club\\'s logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team\\'s logo can cause, but said it would remain the club\\'s logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn\\'t receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples\\' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar\\'s Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club\\'s stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant \\'Indio\\' it\\'s derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club\\'s mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club\\'s website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense\\'s mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn\\'t just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that\\'s very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that\\'s very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won\\'t change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters\\' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as \\'Indios.\\'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile\\'s most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club\\'s badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo\\'s badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn\\'t give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'DENNIS BANKS', 'entity_type': 'PERSON',

      "\n",
      "For Williams that would mean winning a record-tying 24th grand slam title, which has so far proved elusive despite getting close four times since returning to the tour after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia. Her preparation for the year's first major couldn't have gone much better, suggesting the mini grand slam drought for arguably tennis' greatest ever player is about to cease. Williams let rip into a punching bag in December -- drawing a compliment from former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, whose daughter happens to be a budding tennis star -- and then won a buildup tournament in Auckland last week to incredibly land a title in a fourth straight decade. She also mingled with one of tennis' youngest sensations, Coco Gauff, as part of the training camp in Florida organized by her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. JUST WATCHEDMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroe 02:19Read MoreWilliams overcame singles opponents with differing styles, reached the doubles final with one of her best friends -- the soon-to-be retired Caroline Wozniacki -- and most crucially, ended a five-match losing streak in finals with her daughter and husband Alexis Ohanian looking on.  No wonder the 38-year-old said following her straight-set victory over fellow American Jessica Pegula: \"It's pretty satisfying just to get a win in the final. That was really important for me. And I just want to build on it,\" added Williams, who donated her prize money check of $43,000 to bush fire relief efforts in Australia. \"It's just a step towards the next goal.\"Indeed. READ: Can Rafael Nadal match Roger Federer's all-time grand slam record?READ: Player brands Australian Open email a 'slap in the face'Eyes on bigger prizeYes, as nice as it was to be holding the winners' trophy in Auckland -- where Williams once hit 88 unforced errors in a loss to Madison Brengle -- she didn't make the long trip to simply prosper in New Zealand. The much bigger prize is the Australian Open, where Williams triumphed while in the early stages of pregnancy in 2017.  If Williams makes the final in Melbourne -- and she might have to defeat the likes of twice grand slam winner Naomi Osaka and current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty along the way -- she will probably have to then defeat someone with a heftier reputation than the 66th-ranked Pegula. Helping Williams, however, is that one of the main contenders, Bianca Andreescu, isn't in Melbourne because of another injury, this time to a knee. But winning any final -- after losses in grand slam finals to Osaka, Andreescu, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and retiring against Andreescu in the Rogers Cup finale last August -- could potentially be turning point as Williams attempts to draw level with the grand slam haul of Australia's Margaret Court. JUST WATCHEDSerena Williams falls short in major title chaseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSerena Williams falls short in major title chase 01:00\"Serena, she certainly looks hungry, and I think she's got a little momentum going into the Australian Open,\" Chris Evert, the 18-time grand slam champion, told reporters in an ESPN conference call last week. \"And it would probably be the least pressure, this grand slam, to win for her. \"I think every other tournament, the French Open, the clay isn't her best surface. Wimbledon is a lot of pressure, US Open is a lot of pressure. \"This one, the first one of the year, it's a 'Happy Slam,'\" referring to the Australian Open's nickname. \"I think if she just takes a little bit of pressure off herself and she can just play her brand of tennis, I think she's got a good shot at winning it.\"She's better at grand slams than any other player when you look at the last two years.\"The way Wozniacki put it, Williams has a \"big chance\" to match Court. pic.twitter.com/skoZilynH8— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 12, 2020 Other high-profile players, such as Halep and former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova -- who saved four match points last year in Melbourne against Williams and rallied from 5-1 down in the third set after the American rolled her ankle -- aren't discounting her chances, either, despite just falling short recently at grand slams. \"I'm very impressed about her, that she keeps playing at this level, with being a mother and also being a little bit older than us,\" said Halep, who made a mere three unforced errors in downing Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final. \"It's impressive what she does.\"Challenges aheadBut Evert also underscored the stiffer challenges facing Williams. \"There are some darned good players out there that I have a lot of respect for, and the way that Osaka, Barty, Pliskova, Halep ... there's not one or two threats to Serena, there's probably about eight threats, eight players that can probably do some damage and that can compete against her.\"And one more thing is -- I always felt this way -- the older you get, I think the more bad days you may have, days when you feel burned out, days when you don't want to get out of bed, days when you don't have incentive. You don't want to have that day during a grand slam, but sometimes you can't help it.\"JUST WATCHEDSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon titleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon title 01:56Visit our tennis page for more news and videosWilliams figures to still be around towards the end of the Australian Open, but whether it is as the last person standing continues to be the question. \n",

Follow @cnnsport\\n\\nFor Williams that would mean winning a record-tying 24th grand slam title, which has so far proved elusive despite getting close four times since returning to the tour after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia. Her preparation for the year\\'s first major couldn\\'t have gone much better, suggesting the mini grand slam drought for arguably tennis\\' greatest ever player is about to cease. Williams let rip into a punching bag in December -- drawing a compliment from former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, whose daughter happens to be a budding tennis star -- and then won a buildup tournament in Auckland last week to incredibly land a title in a fourth straight decade. She also mingled with one of tennis\\' youngest sensations, Coco Gauff, as part of the training camp in Florida organized by her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. JUST WATCHEDMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroe 02:19Read MoreWilliams overcame singles opponents with differing styles, reached the doubles final with one of her best friends -- the soon-to-be retired Caroline Wozniacki -- and most crucially, ended a five-match losing streak in finals with her daughter and husband Alexis Ohanian looking on.  No wonder the 38-year-old said following her straight-set victory over fellow American Jessica Pegula: \"It\\'s pretty satisfying just to get a win in the final. That was really important for me. And I just want to build on it,\" added Williams, who donated her prize money check of $43,000 to bush fire relief efforts in Australia. \"It\\'s just a step towards the next goal.\"Indeed. READ: Can Rafael Nadal match Roger Federer\\'s all-time grand slam record?READ: Player brands Australian Open email a \\'slap in the face\\'Eyes on bigger prizeYes, as nice as it was to be holding the winners\\' trophy in Auckland -- where Williams once hit 88 unforced errors in a loss to Madison Brengle -- she didn\\'t make the long trip to simply prosper in New Zealand. The much bigger prize is the Australian Open, where Williams triumphed while in the early stages of pregnancy in 2017.  If Williams makes the final in Melbourne -- and she might have to defeat the likes of twice grand slam winner Naomi Osaka and current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty along the way -- she will probably have to then defeat someone with a heftier reputation than the 66th-ranked Pegula. Helping Williams, however, is that one of the main contenders, Bianca Andreescu, isn\\'t in Melbourne because of another injury, this time to a knee. But winning any final -- after losses in grand slam finals to Osaka, Andreescu, Angelique Kerber and Simona Halep and retiring against Andreescu in the Rogers Cup finale last August -- could potentially be turning point as Williams attempts to draw level with the grand slam haul of Australia\\'s Margaret Court.

Wimbledon is a lot of pressure, US Open is a lot of pressure. \"This one, the first one of the year, it\\'s a \\'Happy Slam,\\'\" referring to the Australian Open\\'s nickname. \"I think if she just takes a little bit of pressure off herself and she can just play her brand of tennis, I think she\\'s got a good shot at winning it.\"She\\'s better at grand slams than any other player when you look at the last two years.\"The way Wozniacki put it, Williams has a \"big chance\" to match Court. pic.twitter.com/skoZilynH8— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 12, 2020 Other high-profile players, such as Halep and former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova -- who saved four match points last year in Melbourne against Williams and rallied from 5-1 down in the third set after the American rolled her ankle -- aren\\'t discounting her chances, either, despite just falling short recently at grand slams. \"I\\'m very impressed about her, that she keeps playing at this level, with being a mother and also being a little bit older than us,\" said Halep, who made a mere three unforced errors in downing Williams in the 2019 Wimbledon final. \"It\\'s impressive what she does.\"Challenges aheadBut Evert also underscored the stiffer challenges facing Williams. \"There are some darned good players out there that I have a lot of respect for, and the way that Osaka, Barty, Pliskova, Halep ... there\\'s not one or two threats to Serena, there\\'s probably about eight threats, eight players that can probably do some damage and that can compete against her.\"And one more thing is -- I always felt this way -- the older you get, I think the more bad days you may have, days when you feel burned out, days when you don\\'t want to get out of bed, days when you don\\'t have incentive. You don\\'t want to have that day during a grand slam, but sometimes you can\\'t help it.\"JUST WATCHEDSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon titleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSimona Halep on winning her first Wimbledon title 01:56Visit our tennis page for more news and videosWilliams figures to still be around towards the end of the Australian Open, but whether it is as the last person standing continues to be the question. \\n\\nEntity Types:\\n[1] «PERSON»\\n[2] «ORGANIZATION»\\n[3] «LOCATION»\\n[4] «DATE»\\n[5] «TIME»\\n[6] «MONEY»\\n[7] «PERCENTAGE»\\n[8] «PRODUCT»\\n[9] «EVENT»\\n[10] «LANGUAGE»\\n[11] «NATIONALITY»\\n[12] «RELIGION»\\n[13] «TITLE»\\n[14] «PROFESSION»\\n[15] «ANIMAL»\\n[16] «PLANT»\\n[17] «DISEASE»\\n[18] «MEDICATION»\\n[19] «CHEMICAL»\\n[20] «MATERIAL»\\n[21] «COLOR»\\n[22] «SHAPE»\\n[23] «MEASUREMENT»\\n[24] «WEATHER»\\n[25] «NATURAL_DISASTER»\\n[26] «AWARD»\\n[27] «LAW»\\n[28] «CRIME»\\n[29] «TECHNOLOGY»\\n[30] «SOFTWARE»\\n[31] «HARDWARE»\\n[32] «VEHICLE»\\n[33] «FOOD»\\n[34] «DRINK»\\n[35] «SPORT»\\n[36] «MUSIC_GENRE»\\n[37] «INSTRUMENT»\\n[38] «ARTWORK»\\n[39] «BOOK»\\n[40] «MOVIE»\\n[41] «TV_SHOW»\\n[42] «ACADEMIC_SUBJECT»\\n[43] «SCIENTIFIC_THEORY»\\n[44] «POLITICAL_PARTY»\\n[45] «CURRENCY»\\n[46] «STOCK_SYMBOL»\\n[47] «FILE_TYPE»\\n[48] «PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE»\\n[49] «MEDICAL_PROCEDURE»\\n[50] «CELESTIAL_BODY»\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Entities Relationships.
