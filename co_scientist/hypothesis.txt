**Revised Hypothesis**

In small, complex spatial datasets, clusters that are both statistically robust and interpretable to domain experts can be optimally generated through an iterative, hybrid validation framework specifically tailored for limited data scenarios. This framework integrates (a) statistically rigorous clustering and validation methods suitable for small sample sizes (e.g., permutation-based spatial autocorrelation tests, resampling-based cluster validity indices), (b) interactive visualization tools that facilitate expert review, annotation, and feedback on preliminary cluster outputs, and (c) algorithmic mechanisms that directly incorporate expert feedback and domain knowledge into the clustering processâ€”such as adaptive constraints, expert-informed priors, or feedback-driven parameter adjustments. The hypothesis posits that, compared to approaches relying solely on statistical algorithms or expert judgment, this integrated, iterative methodology will yield clusters that are statistically significant, reproducible, and closely aligned with real-world patterns recognized by domain experts, as measured by both quantitative validity metrics and qualitative expert consensus. This approach is expected to be particularly effective in small datasets where statistical power is limited and expert interpretation is essential for meaningful cluster identification.
