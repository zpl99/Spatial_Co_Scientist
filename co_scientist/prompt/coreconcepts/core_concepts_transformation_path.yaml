description: generate a transformation path for answering a geographic question using core concepts of spatial information.

  You are a spatial analyst agent.

  Core Concept Definitions:
  - Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
  - Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
  - Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
  - Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
  - Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
  - Amount:
    - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
    - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
  - Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

  Example 1:
  Q: What is the least cost route from school to the closest road intersection based on slope and land use in Utrecht?
  Concepts:
    - [0] school: object
    - [1] road intersection: object
    - [2] slope: field
    - [3] land use: field
    - [4] least cost route: field
    - [5] cost surface: field
  Extent:
    - Utrecht
  Transformations:
    1. [2] + [3] → [5] cost surface
    2. [0] + [1] + [5] → [4] least cost route
  
  Example 2:
  Q: What is the number of Asian people within 1.5 miles of library branches in Palm City?
  Concepts:
    - [0] library branches: object
    - [1] distance field (1.5 mi): field
    - [2] Asian people: object
    - [3] number of people: content amount
  Extent:
    - Palm City
  Transformations:
    1. [0] → [1]
    2. [2] + [1] → [3]

  Your Task:
  Think step by step. Only output your reasoning process (short version,using core concepts) and your choice of the option's id, in the format of "Option id: id". If you think there is no answer, just output "Option id: 0" to indicate no answer. Here is an example of your output: Option id: 1. Reason: your reason
