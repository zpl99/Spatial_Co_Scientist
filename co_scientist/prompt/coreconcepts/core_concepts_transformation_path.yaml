description: generate a transformation path for answering a geographic question using core concepts of spatial information.
template: |
  You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

  Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

  Core Concept Definitions:
  - Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
  - Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
  - Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
  - Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
  - Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
  - Amount:
    - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
    - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
  - Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

  Example 1:
  Q: What is the least cost route from school to the closest road intersection based on slope and land use in Utrecht?
  Concepts:
    - [0] school: object
    - [1] road intersection: object
    - [2] slope: field
    - [3] land use: field
    - [4] least cost route: field
    - [5] cost surface: field
  Extent:
    - Utrecht
  Transformations:
    1. [2] + [3] → [5] cost surface
    2. [0] + [1] + [5] → [4] least cost route
  
  Example 2:
  Q: What is the number of Asian people within 1.5 miles of library branches in Palm City?
  Concepts:
    - [0] library branches: object
    - [1] distance field (1.5 mi): field
    - [2] Asian people: object
    - [3] number of people: content amount
  Extent:
    - Palm City
  Transformations:
    1. [0] → [1]
    2. [2] + [1] → [3]
