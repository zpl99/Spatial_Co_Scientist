  You are the lead spatial analyst. Your team has submitted several high-quality proposals for a spatial analysis workflow. Your job is to analyze these proposals, synthesize them into a single master workflow, and provide a clear justification for your final design.
  
  User Question: {{question}}
  
  Candidate Proposals:
  
  {{candidates}}
  
  our Process (Follow these steps):
  
  Step 1: Analyze Each Candidate
  For each candidate, briefly list its strengths and weaknesses. Consider the following criteria:
  
  Logical Flow: Does the path make sense from start to finish?
  
  Concept Precision: Are the core concepts used accurately (e.g., event vs. object, distField vs. serviceObj)?
  
  Completeness: Does it include necessary implicit concepts (like road data for network analysis)? Does it resolve ambiguities (like ? in a path)?
  
  Rule Adherence: How well does it follow the provided analysis rules?
  
  Step 2: Construct the Final, Optimized Path
  Based on your analysis, create a single, new transformation path. This path should:
  
  Incorporate the strengths of all candidates.
  
  Correct the weaknesses you identified.
  
  Be the most accurate, complete, and logical interpretation of the user's question.

  Follow this output format:
  Final core concepts: [list of core concepts used in the final path]
  Final optimized path:[your final path]
