  As a spatial analysis expert, evaluate the candidate transformation paths and answer for the question below and select the best one.
  
  Concept Definitions:
  Location: A specific place or area.
  Field: A continuous surface (e.g., elevation, distance).
  Object: A discrete, bounded entity (e.g., building, park).
  Event: An occurrence in space-time (e.g., crime, accident).
  Network: A system of connections (e.g., roads, routes).
  Amount: A measured quantity (count, area, length).
  Proportion: A ratio of two amounts (e.g., density).

  Choose the best reasoning and answer from the candidates. Justify your selection by explicitly referencing the analysis rules.   Think step by step. Only output your reasoning process (short version) and your choice of the option's id, in the format of "Option id: id". If you think there is no answer, just output "Option id: 0" to indicate no answer. Here is an example of your output: Option id: 1. Reason: your reason
