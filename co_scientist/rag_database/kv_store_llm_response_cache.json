    "return": "The hypothesis explored in this paper revolves around the **\"ejected stellar embryos\" scenario** as a mechanism for the formation of brown dwarfs. This concept, initially proposed by Reipurth & Clarke (2001), posits that brown dwarfs form as protostellar embryos ejected from nascent stellar systems due to dynamical interactions. This process imparts ejection velocities to the brown dwarfs, which in turn influence their spatial distribution within star-forming regions. The present studies aim to test the validity of this hypothesis by investigating the spatial distribution patterns of brown dwarfs in various young star-forming clusters such as IC348, the Orion Trapezium Cluster (OTC), and others, through both theoretical and empirical approaches.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis\nA key focus of the paper is whether the observed distribution of brown dwarfs in star-forming clusters supports predictions made under this hypothesis. For instance, the hypothesis suggests that ejected brown dwarfs may initially exhibit higher ejection velocities (Kroupa & Bouvier, 2003), leading to greater dispersion over time. However, observational evidence from clusters like IC348 and OTC reveals that brown dwarfs tend to remain close to their birth sites, suggesting that their spatial displacement is limited by factors such as cluster potential. The findings align partly with the hypothesis but also underscore the need for modified interpretations, as the expected significant displacement is not observed in many cases.\n\n### Evidence Supporting the Hypothesis\nSignificant evidence in support of the hypothesis arises from studies like Goodwin et al. (2005), which analyze the decay of small stellar systems and the resulting distribution of brown dwarfs. These studies indicate that spatial spread becomes noticeable only after around 5 million years, consistent with the observed distributions in IC348 and OTC. Similarly, the use of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) statistical method has bolstered findings that brown dwarfs in certain clusters exhibit patterns consistent with ejection and subsequent central condensation.\n\n### Broader Implications\nThis hypothesis not only aims to explain the origins of brown dwarfs but also provides insight into the dynamics of young stellar clusters and substellar objects. Observations of similar spatial behaviors between brown dwarfs and lower-mass T-Tauri stars, as well as across clusters of different ages and regions, lend partial credence to the hypothesis while indicating the need for further exploration.",
