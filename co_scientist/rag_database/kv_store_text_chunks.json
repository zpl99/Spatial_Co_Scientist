Some theoretical scenarios suggest the formation of brown dwarfs as ejected stellar embryos in star-forming clusters. Such\na formation mechanism can result in diﬀerent spatial distributions of stars and substellar objects. We aim to investigate the spatial\nstructure of stellar and substellar objects in two well sampled and nearby embedded clusters, namely IC348 and the Orion Trapezium\nCluster (OTC) to test this hypothesis.\nMethods. Deep near-infrared K-band data complete enough to sample the substellar population in IC348 and OTC are obtained from\nthe literature. The spatial distribution of the K-band point sources is analysed using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method. The\nQ parameter and the spanning trees are evaluated for stellar and substellar objects as a function of cluster core radius Rc.\nResults. The stellar population in both IC348 and OTC display a clustered distribution whereas the substellar population is distributed\nhomogeneously in space within twice the cluster core radius. Although the substellar objects do not appear to be bound by the cluster\npotential well, they are still within the limits of the cluster and not signiﬁcantly displaced from their birth sites.\nConclusions. The spatially homogeneous distribution of substellar objects is best explained by assuming higher initial velocities,\ndistributed in a random manner and going through multiple interactions. The overall spatial coincidence of these objects with the\ncluster locations can be understood if these objects are nevertheless travelling slowly enough so as to feel the gravitational inﬂuence\nof the cluster. The observations support the scenario of formation of substellar objects as “ejected stellar embryos”. Higher ejection\nvelocities are necessary but net spatial displacements may not be necessary to explain the observational data.\n\nKey words.

Introduction\n\nObservations of embedded clusters display structure and mass\nsegregation generally thought to reﬂect the structure of molec-\nular clouds from which they were born and the gravitational\npotential of the cluster (Lada & Lada 2003). Massive stars are\nfound to be located at the centers of the clusters and the ra-\ndial distribution of cluster members roughly follow King models\nor power law variations (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998). These\nﬁndings are generally based on observations sampling the stel-\nlar content of the clusters. With the advent of sensitive infrared\ndetectors, the substellar content has been eﬀectively unveiled\nallowing studies of brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects.\nIn the rest of this paper we shall refer to Brown Dwarfs and\nfree-ﬂoating planetary mass objects as BDs without distinction.\nThe BDs are known to be particularly luminous in their early\nstages owing to which hundreds of such objects are detected in\nnear-infrared surveys of embedded clusters (Muench et al. 2003;\nLucas et al. 2005).\n\nThe formation of substellar objects can be explained through\nat least ﬁve alternative mechanisms (Whitworth et al. 2007).\nOne of the important mechanisms, the so-called “ejected em-\nbryos” scenario, advocates formation of BDs as a result of\npremature ejection of protostellar embryos from multiple sys-\ntems. This “ejection scenario” attributes higher velocity dis-\npersion and spatial spread to BDs in comparision to stel-\nlar objects (Reipurth & Clarke 2001; Kroupa & Bouvier 2003).\nObservations of the radial velocities of BDs and stars in Taurus\nand Chameleon star forming regions indicate that there is no\n\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerence in the velocity dispersion between stars\nand brown dwarfs (Luhman et al. 2007). Young stars and BDs\nare also thought to be homogeneously mixed in the Trapezium\ncluster and Taurus molecular cloud. Much of these results are\nobtained by studying a few objects in localized regions of the\ncluster or in a region like Taurus where star formation occurs\nin relative isolation. In a deep near-infrared study of the IC348\ncluster, Muench et al. (2003) analysed the radial distribution of\npoint sources which indicated a relatively homogeneous distri-\nbution of BDs in space compared to the stellar population that is\nbound to the cluster potential.\n\nThe structure analysis of embedded clusters has gained im-\nportance in recent years, since numerical simulations of the star\nformation process on the scales of molecular clouds are avail-\nable (e.g. Bate et al. 2003), which can be tested against obser-\nvational results.

The structures of some\nstar forming clusters have been analysed using the MST method\n(Cartwright & Whitworth 2004; Schmeja & Klessen 2006).\n\nIC348 and the Orion Trapezium cluster (hereafter OTC) are\ntwo nearby well-studied star forming regions for which deep\nnear-infrared data are available.

These are also richly\npopulated clusters where a statistically signiﬁcant sample of sub-\nstellar objects are catalogued. In this letter we will analyse the\nstructure of both IC348 and OTC to study the variations for the\nstellar and BD populations.\n\n2. Data sets and analysis methods\n\nNear-infrared point source catalogs for the OTC were obtained\nfrom the Muench et al. (2002) and Lucas et al. (2005) studies\nvia the on-line VizieR database. The Muench et al. (2002) data\ncover a region centered on the Trapezium cluster to a 10σ de-\ntection limit of K = 18.1 mag and include all the sources found\nby Hillenbrand & Carpenter (2000). The Lucas et al. (2005) data\nobtained through FLAMINGOS on GEMINI south telescope\ncover a region adjacent to the boundary of the Trapezium cluster\nwhich suﬀers from relatively little contamination from the K-\nband nebulosity. We combined both the catalogs taking care of\noverlaps that resulted in a coverage of ∼ 0.◦1 × 0.◦1. In the over-\nlapping regions between the two surveys we chose to use the\nmagnitudes from Muench et al. (2002). Data for the IC348 re-\ngion were obtained from the FLAMINGOS survey described by\nMuench et al. (2003). The data cover an ∼21′×21′ area centered\non the IC348 cluster to a depth of K∼17 mag.\n\nBased on comparisons to pre-main sequence evolution-\nary tracks (Lucas et al. 2005) and luminosity function mod-\nelling (Muench et al. 2002), in the OTC sources brighter than\nK=14 mag can be considered stars and sources with K>14 can\nbe considered BDs. Similarly, in IC348, sources fainter than\nK=15 mag should be complete to 0.04M⊙ brown dwarfs seen\nthrough an extinction of Av ∼7. These estimations take into ac-\ncount the eﬀects of extinction and nebulosity, hence they repre-\nsent a sample not contaminated by such eﬀects. We will use this\nclassiﬁcation in the following analysis to distinguish stars and\nBDs.\n\nControl ﬁeld data were obtained from the 2MASS point\nsource catalog. The control ﬁelds were selected by looking at\nlarge area (5◦) IRAS 100 µm maps and choosing a region of very\nlow emission. Point sources within a circle of radius 15′ were\nextracted with the criteria of photometric quality ﬂags better than\n“D” and without confusion (ccﬂag=0). The Orion control ﬁeld\nis centered at 05h24m −07◦20′. In the case of IC348, the oﬀ-\ncloud control ﬁeld is located at 03h36m +35◦00′; another ﬁeld\non the Perseus molecular cloud centered at 03h39m +31◦20′ was\nalso examined. Although the 2MASS survey 100% complete-\nness limit is at K=14 mag, several reliable detections of K=15-\n17 mag are also found in the point source catalog at a lower σ\nlevel.\n\nWe use the positions and magnitudes to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of the objects by means of a minimum spanning tree,\nthe unique set of straight lines (“edges”) connecting a given set\nof points without closed loops, such that the sum of the edge\nlengths is a minimum (e.g Gower & Ross 1969). We derive the\nmean edge length ℓMST as well as the parameter Q = ¯ℓMST/ ¯s by\ncombining the normalised mean edge length and the normalised\ncorrelation length ¯s as described in Cartwright & Whitworth\n(2004) and Schmeja & Klessen (2006).

We derive the\nmean edge length ℓMST as well as the parameter Q = ¯ℓMST/ ¯s by\ncombining the normalised mean edge length and the normalised\ncorrelation length ¯s as described in Cartwright & Whitworth\n(2004) and Schmeja & Klessen (2006). The Q parameter quan-\ntiﬁes the cluster structure and distinguishes between a centrally\ncondensated cluster (Q > 0.8) and a cluster showing fractal sub-\nstructure (Q < 0.8), while ℓMST can be seen as the mean distance\nbetween two neighbouring objects. We construct the MST using\nthe algorithm of Prim (1957) implemented in an IDL routine.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe MST method was applied on the photometric data to analyse\nthe following:\n\na) The variation of the Q parameter as a function of source\nmagnitude (therefore source mass) selected to construct the tree.\nAt every magnitude (intervals of 0.2 mag), Q was evaluated by\nconsidering all sources brighter than the given magnitude. This\nvariation was studied for the cluster ﬁeld and the control ﬁelds.\nb) The structure of the minimum spanning tree for stars and\nBDs separately. The resultant mean edge lengths ℓMST along\nwith their standard deviation and minimum and maximum val-\nues were obtained for each tree. Projected separations less than\n150 AU (indicating source binarity) are neglected in computing\nℓMST to remove their eﬀect on the overall distribution. Further,\nthe edge lenghts were examined inside and outside a radius that\ndeﬁne the cluster core boundaries.\n\nIn Figures 1 and 2 we show these results for IC348 and OTC.\nIn both ﬁgures, panel a) shows the variation of Q with magni-\ntude, while panels b) and c) show the tree structure for stellar\nand substellar sources respectively. The dotted circles represent\nboundary limits of the cluster as deﬁned by radial proﬁle mod-\nelling. The ℓMST values for each zone enclosed by the bound-\naries, along with the statistics are listed in Table 1.\n\nIt can be seen from Figs. 1a and 2a that the Q values peak\nat brighter magnitudes and show a turn-over at K=14 mag for\nIC348 and K=11 mag for OTC decreasing smoothly towards\nfainter magnitudes. In comparision, the data from the control\nﬁelds do not show signiﬁcant variations of the Q paramater with\nmagnitude. They yield values in the range of Q ≈ 0.72, the\nvalue expected for a random distribution. The peak Q values\nfor IC348 and OTC are 0.9 and 0.94, respectively, indicating\ncentrally condensed conﬁgurations. Following the ﬁndings of\nCartwright & Whitworth (2004) (condensation for Q > 0.8, frac-\ntral substructure for Q < 0.8), these results imply that in IC348\nsources fainter than K=15.5 mag (the point where Q touches\n0.8 in Fig. 1a) are distributed in space with a fractal structure\nwhile brigther sources are more centrally condensed. The same\nintrepretation in OTC suggests a general central condensation\nthat is only weak for the fainter sources.\n\nThe structure of the MST in Figs. 1b and 2b display clusters\nat the center of the ﬁeld while Figs. 1c and 2c display a ho-\nmogeneous distribution of sources. The clustering can be seen\nas branches of smaller edge lengths at the center spreading into\nbranches of longer edge lengths away from the center. It can\nalso be noted that the clusters in Figs. 1b and 2b coincide well\nwith the B star in IC348 and with the Trapezium stars in the\nOTC cluster, shown with ﬁlled star symbols. The fainter sources\ndo not show detectable variations in the tree structure across\nthe ﬁeld. These results are demonstrated more quantitatively in\nTable 1. The linear lengths in Table 1 are derived from the an-\ngular lengths by assuming a distance of 315 pc and 500 pc to\nIC348 and OTC, respectively. The edge lengths for stars and\nBDs are listed individually for each cluster inside and outside\nthe cluster full-width half maximum boundaries (also referred\nas cluster core radius Rc). In the IC348 cluster, the boundaries\nof 5′and 10′ represent the cluster core radius Rc and the limit\nat which the radial proﬁle merges with the background. These\nvalues are adopted from Muench et al. (2002) where the radial\ndistribution of sources is modelled. Similarly, a boundary of\nRc=1.′2 is assumed for OTC based on the King Model ﬁts from\nHillenbrand & Hartmann (1998). In IC348, the ℓMST values for\nstars within Rc=5′and outside vary by a factor of 1.9, whereas\nfor substellar objects (denoted as BDs) they show similar val-\n\n\fM. S. N. Kumar and S.

In IC348, the BDs are clearly\nhomogeneously distributed within the radius of 10′ reproducing\nthe results of Muench et al. (2003). The MST variation of BDs in\nOTC may indicate weak concentration at the center, although the\nregion examined here encompasses only the Trapezium cluster\nwhich is the central part of the much larger Orion Nebula Cluster\n(Hillenbrand 1997).

Schmeja: The spatial distribution of substellar objects in IC348 and the Orion Trapezium Cluster\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe results of the analysis presented in the previous section has\ntwo signiﬁcant parts:\n\na) The BDs are spread uniformly in space and not limited\nby the cluster potential well whereas stars are bound by a well\ndescribed cluster potential. This can be explained if BDs in the\ncluster are seen as an N particle system with higher initial ve-\nlocities than the stars in random directions produced by mul-\ntiple interactions at early times. The net result will be a rela-\ntively uniform distribution of space positions and velocities in-\nstead of being constrained by the gradient of the cluster potential\nwell. Such a scenario of multiple objects and chaotic interactions\nis well described by the numerical simulations such as that of\nBate et al. (2003). However, this process is relevant during the\nearly evolution of the cluster (within 105 yrs) thus setting up the\n“initial” conditions for BDs. Higher initial velocities are nec-\nessary to overcome the cluster potential gradient and produce\nthe homogeneous distribution of spatial locations. The natural\neﬀect of lower mass objects acquiring higher recoil velocities\nin comparision to higher mass objects (Reipurth & Clarke 2001;\nKroupa & Bouvier 2003) can result in BDs having the necessary\nejection velocities. This is in accordance with the predictions\nof Kroupa & Bouvier (2003) who compute higher dispersion in\nejection velocities of 2-3 km s−1 for BDs.\n\nb) The BDs appear slightly more centrally concentrated in\nthe 1 Myr old OTC than in the 3 Myr old IC348 cluster.

While\nthe BDs show a homogeneous distribution in space, they are still\nlimited to the physical boundaries of the cluster or only slightly\nspread out. This is evident from the signiﬁcant number of BDs in\ncomparison to stars in both clusters (see last column of Table 1).\nIt implies that the BDs have not traversed in space signiﬁcantly\naway from the regions where they were born. The more uniform\ndistribution in the 3 Myr old IC348 cluster with respect to the\n1 Myr old OTC imply that, with time, the BDs may indeed be\nmoving away from the cluster center, but the net displacement\nis not signiﬁcant. Assuming higher initial velocities for BDs,\nthe cluster potential that operates on the larger scale, will re-\nduce their overall displacement away from the cluster center.\nGoodwin et al. (2005) examine the spatial distribution of BDs\nproduced by the decay of small N stellar systems as expected\nfrom the embryo ejection scenario and show that signiﬁcant spa-\ntial spread of BDs with respect to stars may occur only after 5\nMyr. Their predictions are consistent with the results of IC348\nand OTC.\n\nThe above results are therefore clear signatures of the sce-\nnario of “ejected stellar embryos” (Reipurth & Clarke 2001;\nKroupa & Bouvier 2003) as an important mechanism for the for-\nmation of brown dwarfs and free-ﬂoating planetary mass objects.\nSeveral studies have been made to investigate the diﬀer-\nences in spatial distribution of stars and BDs in star forming\nregions. In the Chamaeleon I cloud, the distribution of BDs\nand low mass stars was found to be similar (L´opez Mart´ı et al.\n2004) and in the Lupus cloud BDs were found close to their\nbirth sites (L´opez Mart´ı et al. 2005). In the Taurus molecular\ncloud, Brice˜no et al. (2002) examined the distributions of near-\nest neighbours to objects with spectral indices ≤M6 and >M6\nand concluded that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the\nspatial distribution of stars and BDs. Examining a smaller group\nof T-Tauri stars Mart´ın et al. (2001) hinted at an anticorrelation\nbetween density of stars and BDs in Taurus. Luhman (2006) ex-\namined an area of 225 deg2 covering almost the entire Taurus\nMolecular Cloud and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the spa-\ntial distributions of BDs and stars.\n\nThe above studies were made because according to the\n“ejected embryos” scenario, BDs may be expected to be\nsigniﬁcantly displaced from their birth locations. For exam-\nple,assuming a 1D dispersion velocity of 1 km s−1they should\nhave moved ∼1 pc away (corresponding to 7′≈6×Rc) from the\ncluster in 1Myr old OTC or about 3 pc away (corresponding to\n35′≈7×Rc) in the IC348 cluster( if they do not experience any\nretarding force from the cluster potential). However, as evident\nfrom the data presented here, the BDs are indeed located within a\nregion ∼ 2×Rc in both the clusters. Whether there is a signiﬁcant\nconcentration of BDs much farther away from the cluster cores\nin IC348 and OTC is an issue that needs investigation and is be-\nyond the scope of the data analysed here. However, following\nthe example of Taurus, where Luhman (2006) examined the en-\ntire molecular cloud, signiﬁcant populations of BDs away from\nthe dense cores may not be expected.\n\nThe major diﬀerence between previous studies and this work\nis the advantage of large number statistics and space densities of\npoint sources found in IC348 and OTC. This number statistics\nhas made it possible to eﬀectively apply the MST technique to\nanalyse the spatial distribution. In the absence of the MST anal-\nysis, IC348 and OTC would imitate the results of Taurus, ChaI\nor Lupus described above. Indeed in Fig. 2 of Luhman (2006) it\ncan be seen that the BDs are sparsely populated while stars are\nrelatively clustered. MST analysis for Taurus may also show the\nkind of variations found here, but the IC348 and OTC are clearly\nbetter data sets for eﬀective application of the MST method\nwhich is “statistical” in nature. In conclusion, we have shown\nthat the near-infrared observations of the IC348 and OTC em-\nbedded clusters are in accordance with the “ejected stellar em-\nbryos” scenario for the formation of substellar objects. Higher\nejection velocities for substellar objects are essential but their\nspatial displacements from the birth sites may not be necessary\nto explain the observed data.\n\nAcknowledgements.
