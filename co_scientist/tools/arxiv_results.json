    "title": "Bi-directional Mapping of Morphology Metrics and 3D City Blocks for   Enhanced Characterization and Generation of Urban Form",
    "summary": "Urban morphology, examining city spatial configurations, links urban design to sustainability. Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in performance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form generation, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap remains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation, caused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form, particularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of optimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban performance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively characterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse forms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of establishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex urban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance evaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to both characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban forms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing 3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the methodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We use neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding, urban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an effective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms through comparison. The proposed methodology tightly couples complex urban forms with morphology metrics, hence it can enable a seamless and bidirectional relationship between urban form generation and optimization in performance-driven urban design towards sustainable urban design and planning.",

    "title": "From Urban Clusters to Megaregions: Mapping Australia's Evolving Urban   Regions",
    "summary": "This study employs percolation theory to investigate the hierarchical organisation of Australian urban centres through the connectivity of their road networks. The analysis demonstrates how discrete urban clusters have developed into integrated regional entities, delineating the pivotal distance thresholds that regulate these urban transitions. The study reveals the interconnections between disparate urban clusters, shaped by their functional differentiation and historical development. Furthermore, the study identifies a dichotomy of urban agglomeration forces and a persistent spatial disconnection between Australia's wider urban landscape. This highlights the interplay between urban densification and peripheral growth. It suggests the need for new thinking on potential integrated governance structures that bridge urban development with broader social and economic policies across regional and national scales. Additionally, the study emphasises the growing importance of national coordination in Australian urban development planning to ensure regional consistency, equity, and productivity.",

    "title": "Neural Embeddings of Urban Big Data Reveal Emergent Structures in Cities",
    "summary": "In this study, we propose using a neural embedding model-graph neural network (GNN)- that leverages the heterogeneous features of urban areas and their interactions captured by human mobility network to obtain vector representations of these areas. Using large-scale high-resolution mobility data sets from millions of aggregated and anonymized mobile phone users in 16 metropolitan counties in the United States, we demonstrate that our embeddings encode complex relationships among features related to urban components (such as distribution of facilities) and population attributes and activities. The spatial gradient in each direction from city center to suburbs is measured using clustered representations and the shared characteristics among urban areas in the same cluster. Furthermore, we show that embeddings generated by a model trained on a different county can capture 50% to 60% of the emergent spatial structure in another county, allowing us to make cross-county comparisons in a quantitative way. Our GNN-based framework overcomes the limitations of previous methods used for examining spatial structures and is highly scalable. The findings reveal non-linear relationships among urban components and anisotropic spatial gradients in cities. Since the identified spatial structures and gradients capture the combined effects of various mechanisms, such as segregation, disparate facility distribution, and human mobility, the findings could help identify the limitations of the current city structure to inform planning decisions and policies. Also, the model and findings set the stage for a variety of research in urban planning, engineering and social science through integrated understanding of how the complex interactions between urban components and population activities and attributes shape the spatial structures in cities.",

    "summary": "Cities comprise various functional zones, including residential, educational, commercial zones, etc. It is important for urban planners to identify different functional zones and understand their spatial structure within the city in order to make better urban plans. In this research, we used 77976010 bus smart card records of Beijing City in one week in April 2008 and converted them into two-dimensional time series data of each bus platform, Then, through data mining in the big database system and previous studies on citizens' trip behavior, we established the DZoF (discovering zones of different functions) model based on SCD (smart card Data) and POIs (points of interest), and pooled the results at the TAZ (traffic analysis zone) level. The results suggested that DzoF model and cluster analysis based on dimensionality reduction and EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm can identify functional zones that well match the actual land uses in Beijing. The methodology in the present research can help urban planners and the public understand the complex urban spatial structure and contribute to the academia of urban geography and urban planning.",

    "title": "Spatial Patterns in Urban Systems",
    "summary": "Understanding the morphology of an urban system is an important step toward unveiling the dynamical processes of its growth and development. At the foundation of every urban system, transportation system is undeniably a crucial component in powering the life of the entire urban system. In this work, we study the spatial pattern of $73$ cities across the globe by analysing the distribution of public transport points within the cities. The analysis reveals that different spatial distributions of points could be classified into four groups with distinct features, indicating whether the points are clustered, dispersed or regularly distributed. From visual inspection, we observe that the cities with regularly distributed patterns do not have apparent centre in contrast to the other two types in which star-node structure, i.e. monocentric, can be clearly observed. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for the existence of two different types of urban system: well-planned and organically grown. We also study the spatial distribution of another important urban entity, the amenities, and find that it possesses universal properties regardless of the city's spatial pattern type. This result has one important implication that at small scale of locality, the urban dynamics cannot be controlled even though the regulation can be done at large scale of the entire urban system. The relation between the distribution of amenities within the city and its spatial pattern is also discussed.",

    "summary": "Study of urban form is an important area of research in urban planning/design that contributes to our understanding of how cities function and evolve. However, classical approaches are based on very limited observations and inconsistent methods. As an alternative, availability of massive urban data collections such as Open Street Map from the one hand and the recent advancements in machine learning methods such as deep learning techniques on the other have opened up new possibilities to automatically investigate urban forms at the global scale. In this work for the first time, by collecting a large data set of street networks in more than one million cities, towns and villages all over the world, we trained a deep convolutional auto-encoder, that automatically learns the hierarchical structures of urban forms and represents them via dense and comparable vectors. We showed how the learned urban vectors could be used for different investigations. Using the learned urban vectors, one is able to easily find and compare similar urban forms all over the world, considering their overall spatial structure and other factors such as orientation, graphical structure, and density and partial deformations. Further cluster analysis reveals the distribution of the main patterns of urban forms all over the planet.",

    "title": "Urban Forms Across Continents: A Data-Driven Comparison of Lausanne and   Philadelphia",
    "summary": "Understanding urban form is crucial for sustainable urban planning and enhancing quality of life. This study presents a data-driven framework to systematically identify and compare urban typologies across geographically and culturally distinct cities. Using open-source geospatial data from OpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography, multimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide each city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results reveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some cluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale, density, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the grid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared typologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality further demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even with minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally convergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of spatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for planners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and well-being. Limitations related to data completeness and feature selection are discussed, and directions for future work -- including the integration of additional data sources and human-centered validation -- are proposed.",

    "title": "Modelling the multi-scalar effect of commuting on exposure to diversity",
    "summary": "Urban systems are primarily relational. The uneven intensities and distribution of flows between systems of cities results in hierarchically organised complex networks of urban exchange. Distinct urban spatial structures reflect the diversity of functional and social patterns which vary or remain constant across multiple scales. In this work, we examine the impact of commuting on the potential accessibility to spatial and social diversity, and the scalar relations that may exist. We first define relational scales by conducting a process of percolation on the commuting network, as a hierarchical clustering algorithm. This gives rise to a nested structure of urban clusters based on flow connectivity. For each cluster at each scale, we compute measures of commuting structural and social diversity by examining the spatial distribution of origin-destination pairs, and the distribution of workers' skills and occupations. To do this, we make use of global entropy measures allowing us to quantitatively analyse the reachable diversity across scales. Applying this methodology to Chile, we observe that the hierarchical accessibility to the wider system of cities and the patterns of spatial interaction, significantly influence the degree of exposure to diversity within urban systems. This framework examines connectivity-based diversity at multiple scales, and allows for the classification of cities and systems of cities according to the spatial and social dimensions of commuting dispersion. Such insights could contribute to the planning of infrastructural projects connecting the urban system at different scales, while also guiding a strategic relocation and redistribution of economic activities at regional levels.",

    "title": "Mitigating Spatial Disparity in Urban Prediction Using Residual-Aware   Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: A Chicago Case Study",
    "summary": "Urban prediction tasks, such as forecasting traffic flow, temperature, and crime rates, are crucial for efficient urban planning and management. However, existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on accuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions. This oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate existing inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware Attention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these disparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating spatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of residuals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in Chicago, utilizing a travel demand dataset as an example. Our model achieved a 48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in error metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models with RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by reducing errors clustered in central regions. Attention maps demonstrated the model's ability to dynamically adjust focus, leading to more balanced predictions. Case studies of various community areas in Chicago further illustrated the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatial and demographic disparities, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning and policy-making.",

    "title": "Universal scaling of intra-urban climate fluctuations",
    "summary": "Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.",
