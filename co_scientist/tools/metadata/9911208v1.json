  "title": "Limber equation for luminosity dependent correlations",
  "summary": "The passage from angular to spatial correlations, in the case of spatial clustering length depending on the average distance between nearby objects is studied. We show that, in a number of cases, the scaling law of angular correlation amplitudes, which holds for constant spatial clustering length, is still true also for a luminosity dependent spatial correlation. If the Limber equation is then naively used to obtain `the' spatial clustering length from the angular function amplitude, a quantity close to the average object separation is obtained. The case of cluster clustering is explicitly considered.",
