ABSTRACT

Understanding the morphology of an urban system is an important step toward unveiling the dynamical processes of its
growth and development. At the foundation of every urban system, transportation system is undeniably a crucial component
In this work, we study the spatial pattern of 73 cities across the globe by
in powering the life of the entire urban system.
analysing the distribution of public transport points within the cities. The analysis reveals that different spatial distributions
of points could be classiﬁed into four groups with distinct features, indicating whether the points are clustered, dispersed or
regularly distributed. From visual inspection, we observe that the cities with regularly distributed patterns do not have apparent
centre in contrast to the other two types in which star-node structure, i.e. monocentric, can be clearly observed. Furthermore,
the results provide evidence for the existence of two different types of urban system: well-planned and organically grown.
We also study the spatial distribution of another important urban entity, the amenities, and ﬁnd that it possesses universal
properties regardless of the city’s spatial pattern type. This result has one important implication that at small scale of locality,
the urban dynamics cannot be controlled even though the regulation can be done at large scale of the entire urban system.
The relation between the distribution of amenities within the city and its spatial pattern is also discussed.

Introduction

Study of urban systems—how they form and develop—
constitutes an important portion of human knowledge, not
only because it is about our own physical space of daily liv-
ing but also for understanding the underlying mechanisms of
human settlement and civilisation on the Earth’s surface that
may be fundamentally similar to other forms of organisation
like biological cells in our body or animal colonies. Urban
systems, or “cities” in modern terms, are typical example of
highly complex systems1–7 in which overwhelmingly many
agents are interacting in non-trivial and non-linear manners
over a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. The re-
sults of such tangled interactions are the emergence of unex-
pected global patterns that cannot be solely derived from the
local knowledge of individual agents. Among these complex
patterns are the spatial patterns delineated by the physical
locations and shapes of urban entities like buildings, parks,
lakes or infrastructure etc. . . , i.e. the urban morphology.8 A
good understanding of the morphology of an urban system
provides us with the comprehension of its current status of
development or even the living condition of people inside it.
For example, the number of residential buildings is a good
gauge of the population size and the population density mea-
sures the crowdness that every resident has to experience in
his or her daily life, or the infrastructure is an indicator of

how well the city is doing in terms of economy.

In the recent years, with the availability of technologies
and new mapping techniques, various forms of data on urban
systems have been collected.9 These data sets have enabled
researchers to gain a deeper insight into the spatial structures
existing in urban systems. One such data set is on the street
and road networks which form the backbone of any urban
system, and therefore, contain rich information about how
the city is organised. A good amount of research have been
performed on understanding the pattern of streets in many
different cities around the world.10–16 However, there are
shortcomings of studying urban morphology based on street
network when it has been noticed that the streets are not al-
ways well deﬁned.16, 17 Public transport points, conversely,
are well deﬁned and can gauge the level of socio-technical
development in an urban system as they represent the degree
of mobility activities taking place within the urban system.
Furthermore, public transport network is design to serve the
residents of the city to perform activies on every aspect of
daily life (going to school, commuting to work, shopping, en-
tertainmment etc. . . ), and therefore, can be used as a good
proxy of the residential distribution within a city. At the in-
terplay of these factors, spatial pattern of distribution of trans-
port points can provide us with rich insights into the morphol-
ogy or, in some cases, even the morphogenesis of an urban
system.

In this study, we will explore the spatial patterns encom-
passed in urban systems by analysing the pattern of spatial
distribution of transport points (bus stops) in their public
transport network of 73 cities around the world (see “Data”).

 
 
 
 
 
 
The analysis shall reveal that there exists a typical value of
distance among transport points within each city. This char-
acteristic distance reﬂects the accessibility of each transport
point and connectivity of them as an entire network, and
hence, can be employed in measuring the physical area of
the transport network’s coverage. Interestingly, this area is
shown to exhibit a scaling relation against the characteris-
tic distance with a non-trivial value of the scaling exponent.
Furthermore, the spatial distribution pattern of the transport
points can be quantiﬁed and shown to belong to two main
groups in which the points are either approximately equidis-
tant or they are distributed apart with multiple length scales.
The ﬁrst group contains cities that appear to be well-planned,
i.e. organised type, while the second consists of cities that
tend to spread themselves over a large area and possess non-
uniform spatial density of urban entities at different length
scales, i.e. organic type. In addition to public transport net-
work, we also look at the distribution of amenities within
each city to investigate the relation between these two types
of urban entity. We ﬁrst ﬁnd that the distance between ameni-
ties to their nearest transport points within a city follows a ro-
bust exponential distribution across all the cities considered,
regardless of the city’s type being organised or organic. Sub-
sequently, we observe a clear quantiﬁable relation between
this amenity-transport point distance and the density of trans-
port points; and the type of the city can also be seen in this
relation.

Results

Using a method of cluster analysis inspired by percolation
theory,18 we are able to characterise the spatial pattern of
public transport points in urban systems. The spatial spattern
is characterised by quantifying the size and area of a domi-
nant cluster of transport points as functions of a distance pa-
rameter. This distance parameter (also the buffer radius) r
represents the extent of vicinity around every transport point
in the system, hence, the point’s connectivity. Larger value
of r means the neighbourhood of a point is extended, and
therefore, can encompass more points within it. A pair of
points are said to belong to the same cluster if and only if
the Euclidean distance between them is less than or equal to
r . The size of a cluster is deﬁned as the number of points in
the cluster while its area the union of area of circles of uni-
form radius r centred at the points in the cluster. A dominant
cluster is the cluster with either largest size x max(r ) or largest
area Amax(r ). The clusters in the two occasions are not neces-
sarily the same one. For simplicity of all discussions below,
unless stated explicitly, descriptions for cluster size x also
hold for cluster area A.

When r

is small, the number of clusters h (r ) is large
because most of the points are not connected and they
increases, h (r ) decreases
form their own clusters. As r
monotonically because of merger of small clusters.
In
fact, it is a step function because the pairwise distances
between points are discrete in value. On the other hand,

the size of the largest cluster x max(r ) increases monoton-
ically as r
increases. Again, it is also a step function,
but we assume in this study that the proﬁles x max(r ) and
Amax(r ) can be approximated by well behaved and smooth
functions so that their derivatives exist at all points (see
and
“Characteristic distances among transport points”
“Spatial patterns in urban systems”).
In the regime of
small buffer radius r , x max(r ) slowly increases because the
clusters are still disjoint. As r enters an intermediate regime,
x max(r ) increases faster than it does in the small-r
regime.
This is when the larger clusters merge together making the
signiﬁcant expansion in size of the largest cluster. As r
increases further, there is no further signiﬁcant change to
the size of the largest cluster as it has encompassed most
of the points in the domains, leaving only minor portions
surrounding. The intermediate regime of r , therefore, could
be seen as a region of “phase transition”, similar to that in
physics,19 particularly percolation.18

In percolation, every point is assigned a variable called the
percolating probability that controls the ability of one site to
connect to another in the domain. The higher the percolating
probability is, the easier the site is connected to others, and
vice versa. The percolating probability is then viewed as a
control parameter in the system. The transition occurs when
the control parameter is adjusted to a critical value (called the
critical point) at which the system transits from one state (or
phase) to another with distinct properties, namely the non-
percolating and percolating phases respectively at low and
high percolating probabilities. The behaviours of the system
approaching the critical point can then be used to classify the
system, i.e. identifying its universality class.20

Applying this idea to our system of transport points within
a city, the buffer radius r could be viewed as the control pa-
rameter. For small values of r , the system is in segregate
phase, while it is in aggregate phase for large values of r .
The transition from one phase to the other takes place in the
intermediate regime of r . The manner in which the proﬁles
of the largest system size x max(r ) and area Amax(r ) transit
through this region can characterise how the transport points
are distributed within a city.

Characteristic distances among transport points
The intermediate regime of r can be identiﬁed and charac-
dx max(r )
terised by analysing the ﬁrst derivative x
dr

max(r ) =
′

of the cluster size. This quantity, which is interpreted as the
rate of cluster size growth per unit of buffer radius, produces
a peak every time a jump occurs in the cluster size x max(r ),
i.e. when the cluster merges with others and grows. Every
peak in x
max(r ), therefore, signiﬁes the existence of one or
′
a few clusters of points located at a farther distance beyond
those in the current largest cluster that is being traced. As a re-
sult, this would provide us with the information on the length
scales of distribution of points within the set. It can be easily
seen that if there are many peaks, the points are distributed in
clusters that are apart with different distances; whereas the ex-

2/13

istence of few peaks implies a uniform distribution of points
that are (approximately) equidistant from one another. In ei-
ther case, it is without doubt that there exists a characteristic
distance in the spatial distribution of points. This character-
istic distance should tell us the length scale above which the
points are (largely) connected and below which they are dis-
connected.

Since all peaks in the derivative x

max(r ) contribute to the
′
growth of the cluster x max(r ), a measure of the characteristic
distance r ⋆
x must take into account the effects of all of them.
However, a high peak indicates a more signiﬁcant increase in
cluster size (a major merger) than that indicated by a lower
one. Hence, the average of all values of r †
x ,i at which a peak i

occurs, weighted by the height x

max(r †
′

x ,i) =

r =r †
x ,i
of the peaks, is an appropriate measure of this characteristic
distance, i.e.

Spatial patterns in urban systems
The characteristic distances introduced above tell us where-
about the transitions of cluster size and area take place but
they do not tell us how the size and area of the cluster tran-
sit from small to large value, i.e. how the cluster grows. This,
however, can be easily characterised by further exploiting the
analysis of peaks in x
max(r )). It is a matter of
max(r ) (and A′
′
fact that if the cluster grows rapidly through the transition,
there are very few peaks in x
max(r ), all of which are sharp
′
and localised. On the other hand, the peaks are scattered over
a wide range of r should the cluster gradually grow. The stan-
dard deviation of the location r †
x ,i of the peaks, or the spread
of transition s
for cluster size, is a good measure of such
x
scattering. However, a low peak that is distant from a group
of localised high peaks should not signiﬁcantly enlarge the
spread. Therefore, the standard deviation of r †
x ,i needs to be
max(r †
weighted by the height x

max(r ) and area
The analyses of peaks in size proﬁle x
′
max(r ) provide different perspectives on the spa-
proﬁle A′
tial distribution of points. The size quantiﬁes the number
of points with respect to the distance while the area fur-
ther takes into account the relative position of the points.
The two are not redundant but rather, one is complemen-
tary to the other. This comes to light in the next section
“Spatial patterns in urban systems” when the combination
of the two allows us to classify distinct types of distribution
of points.

It is noteworthy that r ⋆

x and r ⋆
A are different from the aver-
age of pairwise distance among all points in the set because
they encode the connectivity of the points in terms of spatial
distribution. In other words, the two characteristic distances
are measure of typical distance between points in the set in
the perspective of global connectivity of all points. In the con-
text of transport points, they translate to the distance one has
to traverse to get from one point to another in order to explore
the entire system. It then follows that a large value of char-
acteristic distance implies a sparsely distributed set of points
which could reﬂect a poorly covering network of transport.
This agrees with a low density of points per unit area (see
“Area of system of transport points” for more details). For
the 73 cities considered in this study, r ⋆
is found to be in the
x
range 200 − 1200m with most cities having r ⋆
in the range
x
200 − 500m. The ranges are 200 − 1700m and 300 − 500m
for r ⋆

The combination of these two spreads of transition enables
us to characterise the pattern of different types of spatial point
distribution by interpreting different regions of the (s
x , s A)
diagram (see Fig. 1). There are four different types of dis-
tribution that can be identiﬁed using the spreads of transi-
x and area s A. The ﬁrst one is the region of
tion in size s
small s
x ≈ s A in which both x max(r ) and Amax(r ) exhibit a
sharp rise. The second one is the stripe of medium-to-large
x ≈ s A in which x max(r ) and Amax(r ) exhibit gradual in-
s
max(r ) has a respective peak
crease and almost every peak in x

x ≫ s A in which
in A′
max(r ) tend to spread over a wider range of r

than those in A′
in which the peaks in x
max(r ) tend to be more localised than
′
those in A′

max(r ). The third one is the region of s

max(r ).

In this analysis, for practical purpose, the regions are deter-

which most of the points are (approximately) equally spaced
from each other, e.g. grid points. The boroughs of Bronx,
Brooklyn and Manhattan of New York city are typical exam-
ples of such kind of distribution (see Fig. 3(a)). The spatial
pattern of the transport point in these cities appears very reg-
ular. In fact, inspecting their street patterns, one can easily
tell the pattern of parallel roads in one direction cutting those
in the other dividing the land into well organised polygons
with almost perfect square and rectangular shapes. Appar-
ently, this feature must be a result of well-designed and top-
down planning before actually building the infrastructure in
the city.13

Multiple-scale regular pattern
The transport points in a city can also be distributed in a reg-
ular manner but at different length scales. For example, the
entire set of points can be divided into several subsets and
within each subset, the points are (quasi-)equally distant from
each others. At larger length scale, i.e. r
increases further,
these subsets of points are again (quasi-)equally distant from
each other, i.e. hierarchical structure. The buffer radius r
can thus be thought to play the rˆole of a zooming parameter.
In this multi-scale regular pattern, the proﬁle of the largest
cluster size x max(r ) and area Amax(r ) experience a signiﬁ-
cant jump every time r changes its zooming level. At the
lowest level are individual transport point. When r zooms
out to the second level, the points that are closest to each
other start to form their respective clusters. Moving to the
next level, the nearby clusters start joining to form larger clus-
ter but there will be many of these “larger clusters”, i.e. the

largest cluster is of comparable size or area to several other
clusters. The most important feature of this spatial pattern
is that the jumps in the proﬁle of x max(r ) correspond well
to those in Amax(r ), even though the locations of the jumps
are spread apart. That leads to the (approximate) equality of
the spread of transitions s
x and s A despite their not being
small. A good example of this type of distribution is the city
of Epsom in Auckland, New Zealand (see Fig. 3(b)).

It is also interesting to note that within a city itself, differ-
ent parts can possess distinct spatial patterns of the transport
points. For example, even though New York city is known
to be a well-planned city with grid-like street patterns, not all
of its ﬁve boroughs share that nice feature. Only Manhattan,
x and s A while the spreads
Bronx and Brooklyn have small s
are larger for the other two boroughs, Queens and Staten Is-
land. This fact indeed complements the result reported earlier
that Queens exhibits a distinct spatial pattern different from
the other boroughs.16 St Louis in Missouri, USA, is another
interesting example. Two halves of the city on the two banks
of Mississippi river appear to have different spatial patterns
when they possess different values of the pair s

x and s A.

Clustered pattern
There are cases in which the jumps in the proﬁle of largest
cluster size x max(r ) don’t correspond to those in the area
Amax(r ) and vice versa. In such cases, the spatial distribu-
tion of the transport points deviates from regular patterns. We
ﬁrst consider the scenarios in which s
x ≫ s A. For such dis-
tributions, the points are clustered and tend to minimise the
x ≫ s A, there are jumps in the size
coverage area. When s

reﬂected by its contribution to s A. However, the size mea-
sure is not affected as it only tells the number of points that
are included in the cluster but not their relative location with
respect to each other.

The distribution of transport points in the city of Turin in
Piedmont, Italy (see Fig. 4(a)), is a good example of this type.
The points appear clustered and compactly distributed but not
regular or grid-like.

Dispersed pattern
On the other side, we have the scenarios of s
x ≪ s A, in
which the points are dispersed and tend to maximise the cov-
erage area. When s
x ≪ s A, there are jumps in the area of
the largest cluster that do not give rise to a jump in its size.

This happens when the points of an acquired cluster are dis-
persed (but still within the buffer radius so that they belong
to the same cluster). This way, the increase in the area of the
largest cluster is more signiﬁcant than that in its size, result-
ing s
x ≪ s A. A good example of this type is the distribution
of transport points in Manchester in Greater Manchester, Eng-
land (see Fig. 4(b)). The points appear in dispersed pattern
of long roads around the city.

If the feature of single-scale regular spatial pattern (when
x and s A are small) is a result of well-designed and
both s
top-down planning in an urban system, the other spatial pat-
terns (either s
x or s A is not small) can be intepreted as a
consequence of developing an urban system under local con-
straints. In the former case, the urban system appears to be

of organised type while in the latter, it can be said to be of
organic type when its spatial features develop in an adhoc
manner as the city grows. The revelation of spatial patterns
in urban systems from the analysis in this work could imply
two different types of process that the cities undergo through
their course of development.

Visually inspecting the spatial distribution of transport
points within the cities, it appears that cities with regularly
distributed pattern, either single- or multiple-scale, do not
have an apparent centre. That means there is no spatial pref-
erence in the distribution of the points, i.e. no part is special
than the others. This is in contrast to the other two types of
cities in which star-node structure can be clearly observed.
The node represents the centre of the city at which there is
higher density of transport points than the other areas, and

from which the roads diverge radially to the outer part of the
city. This observation could by explained by the growth pro-
cess of different types of urban system. When a city grows
organically, it starts from a central business district and grad-
ually expands to encompass the nearby area to accommodate
more people wanting to participate the business activities at
the centre. On the other hand, when a city is planned before,
the planners seem not to concentrate the infrastructure in one
conﬁned area but stretch it across the entire city.

Universal features in urban systems
Area of system of transport points
Despite the difference in the spatial pattern of the distribu-
tion of transport points, all the cities considered in this study
appear to possess a common relation between the density of

7/13

points and the characteristic distance of area r ⋆
A. To explore
this, we ﬁrst deﬁne the characteristic area of a set of points
which is the union area of circles of radius r ⋆
A centred at all
points in the set, X (r ⋆
A). The characteristic distance of area
r ⋆
A represents the typical value of r at which the area of the
entire system experiences the transition. Further increase in
r after that does not contribute to as much increase in the
area of the largest cluster and the cluster, thus, would entail
unnecessary area. The value of X (r ⋆
A) is therefore expected
to be a good proxy to the essential area covered by the set of
points given their spatial distribution. In the case of transport
system, we call this area the serving area of all the transport
points.

Having deﬁned the area, it is easy to calculate the density
of points per unit area, which is simply the ratio between the

number of points and the area they cover,

. From em-

pirical analysis, we ﬁnd the data ﬁt very well to the relation

N
X (r ⋆

(r ⋆

A)−t

(5)

with t ≈ 1.29. Figure 5 shows the empirical relation between
the two quantities. The relation in Eq. (5) is well obeyed by
all 73 cities. It is a remarkable relation given the scattered
relation between r ⋆
A). For reference, the arti-
ﬁcial generated data, including both random and regular pat-
terns (see “Discussion” for details) are also included in the
plot but not in the ﬁtting itself. As can be observed, those
points generally stay below the points for the 73 cities.

A and N or X (r ⋆

It should be further noted that the relation in Eq. (5) or
Fig. 5 is not a trivial one. To see this, we consider the two
in extreme limits, r ≫ 1 and r ≪ 1, and its
scenarios of r
N
. For the small extreme value, r ≪ 1, all

relation with

clusters include only a single point, and there are, hence, N
clusters. We, therefore, have

X (r ) = Npr

which yields the relation

r −2.

(6)

(7)

At the other extreme value, r ≫ 1, there is only one single
cluster that encompasses all points concentrating at the centre
of the union area. We, therefore, have

X (r ) ≈ pr

2,

which leads to

N
X (r )

N

pr

(8)

(9)

which in turn displays scaling behaviour like in Eq. (5) if and
only if the number of points N scales with r .

The whole argument about the extreme values of r

is to
illustrate that the scaling relation in Eq. (5) with exponent

t = −1.29 is not a relation that can be achieved with any
value of r . The relation can only hold at some value of the
buffer radius like r ⋆
A, given the structure in the distribution of
N points. Because of this feature, we consider r ⋆
A the charac-
teristic distance of a set of spatially distributed points.

Amenity distribution
Beside transport system, which is represented by a network
of transport points, the morphology of an urban system can
also be understood from another angle by examing the dis-
tribution of amenities within it. It turns out that despite pos-
sessing different types of distribution of transport points, the
cities appear to share a common universal distribution of
amenities. The analysis of locations of amenities in all the
cities reveals that the (Euclidean) distance W
k of an amenity k
to its nearest transport point follows a robust exponential dis-
tribution. That means the probability of ﬁnding an amenity
with distance W
to its nearest transport point decays exponen-
tially with W
, i.e. its probability density function is given by

P(W ) = l e−l

,

(10)

which renders its mean and standard deviation (not variance)
equal

hW i = s (W ) =

hW
q

2i − hW i2 =

l

.

(11)

In Fig. 6, the mean hW i and standard deviation s (W ) of
shortest amenity-transport point distance for different cities
are shown to stay close to the diagonal line s (W ) = hW i.
The exponential distribution of the distance W
is strongly sup-
ported by further veriyﬁng that higher moments of the distri-
bution P(W ) ﬁt well to

hW

ni =

n!
l n ,

(12)

up to fourth order, n = 4.

It has to be emphasized that the distribution of distance
from amenities to their nearest transport points follows an ex-
ponential rather than a Poissonian one. That means the mean
of such distance is (approximately) equal to its standard devi-
ation rather than variance which holds for a Poisson distribu-
tion. The robust distribution of amenities across all city types
has one important implication that the local growth process
in urban systems appears to be independent of human inter-
vention and larger scale of the entire system. That means
planners can plan the large-scale growth process like trans-
portation but the small-scale growth process like local busi-
ness still takes place on its own. But it remains a signiﬁcant
question why the distribution is exponential, not any other
form. In fact, exponential decay in spatial urban patterns has
been long reported in literature.21 Using this feature as a fact,
a model has been constructed to successfully capture the mor-
phology of urban systems.22

It could be observed that

There appears to be a relation between the density of trans-
port points within a city and the distribution of its amenities.
Figure 7 depicts this relation by plotting the average distance

only the lower-left triangle of the plot is occupied, leaving
no points in the upper-right corner of the plot. That means
there are no cities with high density of transport points and,
at the same time, having large (average) distance between its
amenities and the nearest transport points. This can be easily
understood by the fact that in cities with high density of the
transport points, the road network is very dense, the transport
points have to stay within a short distance of each other. As
a result, the amenities must necessarily be built very close to
the public transport points. It turns out that those cities with
very high density of transport points are those with single-
scale regular pattern of distribution, i.e. the points are regu-
larly distributed at (approximately) equal distances from each
other like grid points, such as San Francisco or the boroughs
of New York city.

At the other end, the cities with low density of public trans-
port points can exhibit a wide spectrum of average amenity-
transport point distance hW i. These cities can either have

large or small hW i. A large value of hW i (and hence, large
standard deviation s (W ), too) implies a city with sparse dis-
tribution of amenities when they are distant from the nearest
transport point like Dallas or San Antonio in Texas, USA.
On the other hand, a small value of hW i suggests that the
amenities are built close to public transport points implying
the existence of sub-centres or several small towns or districts
within the city, such as Turin in Piedmont, Italy.

Discussion

The present work analyses the features of the spatial distri-
bution patterns of important entities in an urban system, the
public transport points and the amenities. The former ones
are part of the backbone of any urban system, the street net-
work which plays essential rˆole in enabling ﬂow or exchange
of various processes in the city. The advantage of knowledge
of these transport points is that they can be well deﬁned and
easily collected and at the same time provide other informa-
tion like the residential distribution within the city. The latter
ones, on the other hands, can gauge the size of population
as well as the level of activities in the city. The results unveil
different types of city with distinct spatial patterns. The cities
are shown to be either of organised type, in which the entities
are well spaced as if they are built top-down, or of organic
type, in which the entities are spaced with multiple length

scales as if they grow spontaneously. In either cases, the typ-
ical distance among the transport points can be described by
a characteristic distance. Despite the different types of the
cities’ spatial patterns, the density of the transport points ex-
hibits universal scaling behaviour with this characteristic dis-
tance. On the other hand, the distance from amenities to their
nearest transport points also follows a robust exponential dis-
tribution for all cities studied. Furthermore, there is an appar-
ent relation between the distributions of transport points and
amenities within the cities. These facts signify some univer-
sal mechanisms underlying the growth and development that
all cities have to undergo.

In an attempt to understand the processes that generate
the spatial distribution patterns of the transport points, we
artiﬁcially generate some distributions of points on a two-
dimensional surface. In the ﬁrst distribution, the points are
generated at random locations within a domain with uniform
probability. In the second distribution, starting from a regu-

lar grid of points in a square lattice, the points are randomly
displaced by a small amount not more than a quarter of the
lattice spacing. It turns out that both the randomly and regu-
larly generated data produce simple behaviours through our
analysis. In particular, the peaks in size and area generally
coincide with each other and stay localised (the random sets
tend to produce more peaks while the regular ones have only
one peak as expected), and hence, both s
x and s A are small
indicating regular pattern of distribution. At this point, we
would like to link the analysis with the idea of measure of
complexity of a symbolic sequence.23–25 The idea states that
both regular and random (in the sense of a random number
generator) sequences possess very low measure of complex-
ity as their structures or patterns are simple and easy to be
presented in terms of the so-called e -machine.23 Along that
line, it could be argued that the patterns observed in the dis-
tributions of transport points from the real data of 73 cities
around the world are more complex then those in the artiﬁ-

cially generated data. The generated data, which is meant
to be either regular or completely random possess, only sim-
ple structure as we have argued above with small spreads s
x
and s A. The real world data might well contain mixtures be-
tween regular and random patterns that could result in both
the clustered and dispersed patterns that we have reported in
“Spatial patterns in urban systems”.

Method

General ideas
For the analysis, we propose a procedure to characterise the spatial pattern of
a set of points. The procedure involves identifying clusters of points, whose
pairwise distance does not exceed the value of a parameter, and quantifying
the growth of the clusters as the parameter value increases.

Consider a domain D which can be thought of as a city or a town. In this
domain, there are N points i distributed, each of which represents a transport
point located at coordinates (xi,yi). We introduce a parameter called the
buffer radius r

to construct the clusters. Any point j, whose distance

di j =

(xi − x j)2 + (yi − y j)2

(13)

q

from point i is less than or equal to r , belongs to the same cluster as i. We
denote h (r ) as the number of clusters given the buffer radius r . For each
cluster a
, we deﬁne the cluster size x a (r ) and the cluster area Aa (r ). The
cluster size is deﬁned as the number of points in the cluster and the cluster
area the union of area of circles of uniform radius r centred at the points in
the cluster. To make different domains comparable, we normalise the cluster
size x a (r ) by the number of points N in the domain, while the cluster area

Aa (r ) by the union of area X (r ) of circles of radius r centred at all points
in the domain.

The identiﬁcation of the clusters can be done by using a simple heuristic
cluster ﬁnding algorithm that starts with a random points in the set and grad-
ually identiﬁes the other points of in the same cluster. Alternatively, one can
employ the method of DBSCAN,26 setting the noise parameter to be zero.
The two methods are identical and yield the same results.

Analysis
For any cluster-related quantity, we attach the subscript x
to associate it with
cluster size while A for cluster area. For simplicity of all discussions, unless
stated explicitly, descriptions for cluster size x also hold for cluster area A.
To quantify the spatial pattern of the set of points, we vary the buffer ra-
dius parameter r . As r
increases, the farther points can belong to the same
cluster. As a result, the clusters can merge to increase their size. Tracing
the behaviour of the largest cluster x max(r ) can provide us with the way the
points are distributed within the set. For example, the proﬁle of the ﬁrst
derivative x
) can indicate at
which distance r , the points are (largely) connected in a single cluster. Be-
cause x max(r ) increases monotonically with r , we introduce the so-called
characteristic distance r ⋆
x at which x max(r ) exhibits the most signiﬁcant in-
crease. In some cases, the proﬁle x max(r ) shows a sharp narrow increase
around a value r . While in other cases, several small increases are observed,
spreading a wide range of r . To account for that, it is also meaningful to
introduce a quantity s
x , called spread of transition, to measure the overall
width of the increases in the proﬁle of x max.

We refrain from looking at the average value of distribution of the cluster
size or area as these measures are vulnerable against errors in data, i.e. out-
liers. For example, when the buffer radius r
is sufﬁciently large that most
but a few of the points in the dataset belong to a single large (“giant”) cluster,
there are only two (or more) clusters and the average cluster size would be
half (or less) of what it is supposed to be.

Peak analysis
As the buffer radius r
increases, the size of the largest cluster x max(r ) also
increases. It can be easily observed that the proﬁle of x max(r ) exhibits an
either sharp or gradual increase. The former introduces a single dominant
peaks in the proﬁle of x
max(r ) while the latter a set of peaks scattering over
′
a wide range of r . This scattering of peaks can be quantiﬁed using the
standard deviation of their locations, weighted by the strength (height) of
the peaks. A small standard deviation implies a sharp increase in x max(r ),
and vice versa, a large standard deviation signiﬁes a gradual increase.

In our analysis, we consider the proﬁle of x

max(r )) at every

This discrete nature also produces a lot of small noisy peaks. In our analysis,
we ﬁlter these noisy peaks by offsetting the entire proﬁle of x

The cluster analysis is implemented in Python, using shapely library to
calculate the union area. We also use DBSCAN library for DBSCAN analysis

Data

Data collection
The public transit-related data was collected by Baseride Technologies us-
ing different available API (application programming interfaces) provided
by transit agencies. Collected data included (but not limited to) GPS (global
positional system) coordinates of bus stops, their characteristics (e.g. name),
route geometry, bus stop sequence on the routes. Additional information was
also collected for future analysis (schedules, trips, real time public transport
location updates). Majority of agencies provides information through GTFS
(general transit feed speciﬁcation). Minority of cities are using their custom-
made APIs. Baseride converted all protocols into single uniform data repre-
sentation. Information about public transit network was also converted into
linked graph for convenient analysis using different methods. The data for
Singapore was obtained from Transit Link Pte Ltd.27 The data set was also
augmented with data from OSM.

The amenity data for all cities was obtained from OSM through the
Mapzen project.28 An amenity is said not to belong the city if it is not
within 1,000m of any bus stop in that city.

The datasets contain information about location of the bus stops in the
form of latitude and longitude. The stops are grouped for the same city
or municipal organisation. In the present analysis, we only select 73 cities
with at least 1,000 bus stops. Those include the cities in England, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, United States, China, Japan, South Korea,
Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The full list of cities can be found
in Fig. 2.

Data preprocessing
For each dataset, the spherical coordinates of each bus stop in latitude q and
longitude j are transformed to quasi-planar two-dimensional Cartesian coor-
dinates. We could have done the transformation by employing the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) conformal projection, but since all datasets are

conﬁned within areas on Earth’s surface spanning less than 100km in both
dimensions, we ﬁnd the approximation method below sufﬁcient, with errors
being less than 0.5%.29

We convert the spherical coordinates fff

i,q i) to Cartesian coordi-
nates rrri = (xi,yi) for every point i in the dataset by ﬁrst setting the origin of
the plot. The origin O is the centroid of all points

i = (j

O = hfff

ii =

for which rrrO = (0,0). The Cartesian coordiantes of a point i is then deter-
mined based on its great-circle distance from the origin O. In particular, the
x-coordinate of i is its (signed) great-circle distance from the point that has
the same longitude j O as O and the same latitude q i as i itself. On the other
hand, the y-coordinate of i is its (signed) great-circle distance from the point
that has the same latitude q O as O and the same longitude j
i as i itself. The
great-circle distance is calculated using the “haversine” formula and, hence,
the Cartesian coordinates of point i are given by
