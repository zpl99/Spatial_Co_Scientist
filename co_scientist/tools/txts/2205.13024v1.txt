Abstract 

 Interpolating a skewed conditional spatial random field with missing data is cumbersome 

in the absence of Gaussianity assumptions. Maintaining spatial homogeneity and continuity 
around the observed random spatial point is also challenging, especially when interpolating 
along a spatial surface, focusing on the boundary points as a neighborhood. Otherwise, the point 
far away from one may appear the closest to another. As a result, importing the hierarchical 
clustering concept on the spatial random field is as convenient as developing the copula with the 
interface of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and concurrently utilizing the idea of the 
Bayesian framework. This paper introduces a spatial cluster-based C-vine copula and a modified 
Gaussian kernel to derive a novel spatial probability distribution. Another investigation in this 
paper uses an algorithm in conjunction with a different parameter estimation technique to make 
spatial-based copula interpolation more compatible and efficient. We apply the proposed spatial 
interpolation approach to the air pollution of Delhi as a crucial circumstantial study to 
demonstrate this newly developed novel spatial estimation technique.

1  Introduction 
 The  upward  trend  of  Particulate  Matter  (𝑃𝑀)  concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  and  air 
pollution has become the greatest threat to human civilization daily. Every year, nearly 0.8 million 
people die due to the direct and indirect effects of air pollution, and approximately 4.6 million 
people  suffer  from  serious  diseases  such  as  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD), 
respiratory hazards, premature deaths, and so on [ (Auerbach, 2012), (Lim, 2012), (WHO, 2016)]. 
It is unavoidable that the air-pollutant concentration is estimated with greater accuracy to control 
air  pollution.  The  spatial  and  spatio-temporal  application  of  geostatistics  is  crucial  during 
prediction.  

A very interesting task in geostatistics is, to interpolate a value of the target variable at a 
specific  time  stand,  in  an  unobserved  location,  taking  its  surroundings  into  account.  In  this 
scenario, the researchers prefer to use Inverse Distance Weight (IDW), Ordinary Kriging (OK), 
Universal Kriging (UK), Disjunctive Kriging (DK), etc [ (Cressie, 2015), (Isaaks, 1989)]. Because

of significant advances in data science, many scientists prefer neural networking-based spatial and 
spatio-temporal  interpolation  techniques  like  Geo-Long  Short  Time  Memory  (Geo-LSTM), 
Random Forest Regression Kriging (RFK), and others [ (Ma, 2019), (Shao, 2020)]. The previously 
mentioned algorithms use the variance-covariance function as a measure of dependence. The main 
drawback of this traditional spatial interpolation algorithm is the gaussianity assumption, rarely 
met.  The  neural  networking-based  algorithms  outperform,  but  the  mathematical  justification  is 
difficult;  as  a  result,  applying  this  model  in  other  cases  can  be  challenging.  These  significant 
limitations promote the use of the copula-based spatial and spatio-temporal interpolation approach. 
This  copula-based  spatial  interpolation  technique  is  both  theoretically  and  practically  flexible. 
Spatial variability is easily captured using copula, and then spatial lag-based Gaussian and non-
Gaussian  bi-variate  copulas  are  created  to  interpolate  four  different  groundwater  quality 
parameters  in  Baden-Wurttemberg  [  (Bardossy  A.  ,  2006)].  Following  that,  many  advances  in 
spatial copula are established, for example, the utilization of asymmetric copulas to measure spatial 
independence  [  (Bardossy  A.  a.,  2009)],  the  use  of  Gaussian  and  non-Gaussian  vine  copula  to 
derive the conditional distribution in the unobserved location [ (Bardossy A. , 2011)], employing 
the convex combination of archimedean copulas to kriging [ (Sohrabian, 2021)]. Besides these, 
application  of  the  Gaussian  Copula  (GC)  via  bayesian  framework  to  predict  the  maximum 
temperatures  in  the  Extremadura  Region  in  southwestern  Spain,  for  the  period  1980–2015  [ 
(Garcia,  2021)],  and  making  use  of  a  bi-variate  copula  [  (Masseran,  2021)]measures  the 
dependence  between  air  pollution  severity  and  duration.  Employing  the  copula-based  bias-
correction  method  [  (Alidoost,  Stein,  Su,  &  Sharifi,  2021)]  develops  three  multivariate  copula 
based quantile regression to map daily air temperature data, modeling the spatial pattern and spatial 
dependence structure of different climate variables, for instance, precipitation, air temperature by 
using regular (C- and D-) Vine copula and the student t-copula [ (Khan, Spöck, & Pilz, 2020)]. 
Utilizing extreme value  models like, the generalized Pareto  distribution (GPD), [  (Masseran & 
Hussain, 2020)] proposes a combination of a GPD model with copulas to establish a dependence 
model between PM 10 and a set of four major pollutant variables, namely, CO, NO 2, SO 2, and 
O3,  employing  the  concept  of  an  extra-parameterized  multivariate  extreme  valued  copula  [ 
(Carreau & Toulemonde, 2020)] introduces a spatial copula model, application of D-vine copula 
based quantile regression to model the spatial and Spatio-temporal data of COVID-19 in Italy [ 
(D’Urso, De Giovanni, & Vitale, 2022)]. After capturing the seasonality and temporal dependency 
of the daily mean temperature data set a new spatial distance based R-vine copula is introduced [ 
(Erhardt,  Czado,  &  Schepsmeier,  2015)],  and  the  usage  of  spatial  vine  copula  based  upon  the 
spatial  lag  [  (Gräler,  2014),  (Bostan,  Stein,  Alidoost,  &  Osei,  2021)].  With  the  help  of  the 
Metropolis-Hastings  Algorithm  (MHA),  they  have  improved  spatial  copula  in  the  Bayesian 
framework to approximate the posterior predictive density whereas, this method is limited to the 
Gaussian copula family [ (Kazianka & Pilz, 2011)]. Utilizing spatial vine copula and dimension 
reduction transformation [ (Musafer & Thompson, 2017)] creates a non-linear optimal multivariate 
spatial design to mitigate prediction uncertainty of more than one variable. Introducing the copula-
based semi-parametric algorithm [ (Quessy, Rivest, & Toupin, 2015)] models the stationary and 
isotropic spatial random fields. Considering the concept of generalized method of moments [ (Bai, 
Kang,  &  Song,  2014)]  proposes  a  pairwise  composite  likelihood  with  the  help  of  pair  copula. 
Discovering  a  spatial  factor  copula  model  [  (Krupskii,  Huser,  &  Genton,  2018)]  combines  the 
flexibility of a copula, the accountability of factor models, and the tractability of GC in higher 
dimensions  to  fit  spatial  data  at  different  temporal  replicates.  Extending  the  spatial  GC 
interpolation method [ (Gnann, Allmendinger, Haslauer, & Bárdossy, 2018)] predict the primary 

2 

 
variable, groundwater quality using the categorical information of the primary variable considered 
as  a  secondary  variable.  Introducing  two  spatial  copula  interpolation  methods,  accountable  to 
justify  the  spatial  dependency  of  an  air  temperature  of  a  particular  location  on  its  geo-spatial 
neighborhood, and another mixture copula [ (Alidoost, Stein, & Su, 2018)] explain the relationship 
of a variable with other covariates. A translation process (TP) is discovered [ (Richardson, 2021)] 
for a non-Gaussian spatial copula interpolation process and too effective to model, where the link 
function  is  not  well  defined.  [  (Wang,  Wang,  Deng,  Zou,  &  Wang,  2021)]  develops  a  spatio-
temporal  heterogeneous  copula-based  kriging  (HSTCAK).  The  space-time  dependency  is 
measured  by  the  copula  function  and  the  spatial  variability  with  temporal  similarity  and  fuzzy 
clustering  employed  for  partition  to  mitigate  the  heterogeneity  problem.  Introducing  crucial 
advancements in the spatial copula approach like tail dependency and asymmetric dependency and 
extension of the linear model of coregionalization specifically for modeling the multivariate spatial 
data [ (Krupskii & Genton, 2019)], and they use cross-covariance function as the measure of spatial 
dependence.  

The research articles used copulas in the spatial interpolation very well in the literature, but 
there are some constraints that the previous authors have ignored. To estimate parameters, they 
use the Maximum Likelihood estimate, which does not provide a good estimate in presence of 
missing data. (ii) After creating spatial copula interpolation, they fix one point and calculate the 
probability distribution at different lags from that point. As a result, the copula is limited within 
the fixed reference frame, but the reference frame is random in reality. That is why, we consider 
the  random  points  and  form  a  cluster,  based  on  relative  distance.  (iii)  At  the  time  of  spatial 
clustering, they disregard the significance of creating the disjoint regions, thus the intersection part 
is the most affected area, where the different effects of different clusters become confused with 
each other (iv) They use conditional expectation for interpolation, but it is invalid for the extremely 
valued probability density function (PDF). 

In  this  study  we  evolve  a  novel  spatial  cluster-based  copula  modeling  in  different 
frameworks. We devide the entire spatial domain into k spatial clusters to get m number of spatial 
regions i.e. ℒ𝒾 ⊆ 𝐑𝟐×𝟐 which is the class of all possible set of points in a spatial region. We create 
a  conditional  spatial  random  field 𝑌: ℒ𝒾 × ℱ𝜇∗ → ℳ.  Here, ℱ𝜇∗ is  an  induced  probability  space 
and  ℱ𝜇∗ = {𝐴 ∈ ℒ𝒾  |  𝐴  is  𝜇∗ −
created 
measurable  𝑖. 𝑒.  𝜇∗(𝐴) ≤ 𝛿} and 𝑌 is < ℒ𝒾 × ℱ𝜇∗, ℳ > measurable  random  field  and ℳ ⊆ 𝐑. 
Our objective in this research is to predict 𝑌 at an unobserved location on 𝑠0 ∈ ℒ𝒾 based upon the 
n  distinct  observed  location 𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . . . , 𝑠𝑛 ∈ ℒ𝒾  using  spatial  copula  interpolation  algorithm  in 
classical and bayesian framework.

2.1  Fitting Marginal Distribution 
 In this particular section, we illustrate how to fit the ideal univariate parametric distribution 
on  the  empirical  marginal  likelihood  distribution.  We  have  divided  the  complete  appropriate 
procedure  into  a  few  steps:  (i)  Choice  of  a  family  of  distributions,  (ii)  Some  sort  of  suitable

marginal  probability  distribution  among  that  family,  and  (iii)  Typically  the  estimate  of  the 
parameter of these suited marginal probability distribution. For step (i) we use the Cullen and Frey 
graph of skewness-kurtosis plot, for step (ii) we utilize Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) centering 
on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), Log-likelihood 
value  (LogLik),  and  Kolmogrov  Smirnov  (KS)  values.  Although  we  face  a  real  challenge  in 
coordination (iii) because there is missing data so the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of 
the  parameter  is  not  recommendable.  Therefore,  for  the  Parametric  Exponential  Family 
distribution  (PEF)  we  are  making  the  use  of  Expectation-Maximization  algorithm  (EM)  [ 
(McLachlan & Krishnan, 2007)] and for the circular probability distributions, we use Uniformly 
Minimum  Variance  Unbiased  Estimator  (UMVUE)  technique.  For  PEF  we  consider  the  fitted 
distribution  is  Log-Normal  (LN)  probability  distribution  then, 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑊 ∼ 𝒩(𝜇, 𝜎2).  Let, 𝑤𝑖; 𝑖 =
1,2,3, . . . , 𝑛1 are  the  observed  data  points  and 𝑤𝑖; 𝑖 = 𝑛1 + 1, 𝑛1 + 2, 𝑛1 + 3, . . . , 𝑛2 are  the  un-
observed data points. The likelihood function of (𝜇, 𝜎) based upon the observed data:

 Let’s consider the E-step on the (𝑚 + 1)𝑡ℎ iteration of the EM algorithm where (𝜇 (𝑚), 𝜎(𝑚)) is 
the  value  after  the 𝑚𝑡ℎ  iteration  of  EM.  Using  the  Equation  (2)  we  compute  the  conditional 
expectation of log-likelihood of the complete data (CElikC) based upon the updated value at the 
𝑚𝑡ℎ iteration, defined as 𝒬 ((𝜇, 𝜎)|(𝜇 (𝑚), 𝜎(𝑚))) in the following: 

𝒬 ((𝜇, 𝜎)|(𝜇 (𝑚), 𝜎(𝑚)))
= 𝐸(𝜇(𝑚),𝜎(𝑚))[𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑐(𝜇, 𝜎)|𝒚]

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑐(𝜇,𝜎)
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑜(𝜇(𝑚),𝜎(𝑚))
 Using the Equation (1), (2) we will simplify the Equation (3) and then in M-step we maximize 
𝒬 ((𝜇, 𝜎)|(𝜇 (𝑚), 𝜎(𝑚))). Therefore the updated values are (𝜇 (𝑚+1), 𝜎(𝑚+1)) which is defined in 
the following: 

]

(𝜇 (𝑚+1), 𝜎(𝑚+1)) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝜇,𝜎)𝒬 ((𝜇, 𝜎)|(𝜇(𝑚), 𝜎(𝑚)))

 Utilizing Equation (4), we get the estimate of the parameter. But to estimate the parameter of a 
circular  probability  distribution  for  example,  Von-Mises  (VM)  distribution,  avoiding  the 
computational complexity of EM algorithm, absence of closed form, and due to the presence of

Bessel Function (𝐼𝑛(𝑘)) we introduce a new theorem regarding the completeness and sufficiency 
of an estimator to deduce a UMVUE of the parameter of VM distribution in the following:

 and 

𝐼0(𝑘)⋅𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥𝑖)

Proof. See Appendix (6.1)  
 Using  Theorem  (2.1)  and  trigonometric  inverse  function  we  get  the  initial  value  and, 

update the parameter values of VM distribution like LN (see Appendix (6.2)).  

2.2  Copula 
  A copula is used to model the dependence between two or more random variables, for 
formulating the joint multivariate distribution from the marginal cumulative distribution function 
(CDF).  Let, 𝑋1, 𝑋2, . . . , 𝑋𝑛 be 𝑛 random  variables  (RV)  with  corresponding  marginal  CDF  s  are 
respectively,  𝐹1(𝑥1), 𝐹2(𝑥2), . . . , 𝐹𝑛(𝑥𝑛) .  The  joint  distribution  function  can  be  defined  as, 
𝐹𝑋1,𝑋2,...,𝑋𝑛(𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑛)  which  is  the  product  of  marginal  and  conditional  distribution  but, 
because of the complexity of this approach with the increasing number of random variables this 
approach is not applicable for the large number of random variables. Therefore, the copula function 
is defined to create a multivariate distribution from the 𝑛 marginal distribution [ (Nelsen, 2007), 
(Sklar, 1973)] to model the dependence between the multidimensional variables in the following 
way:  

𝐶: [0,1]𝑛 → [0,1] 

𝐹𝑋1,𝑋2,...,𝑋𝑛(𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) = 𝐶(𝐹1(𝑋1), 𝐹2(𝑋2), . . . , 𝐹𝑛(𝑋𝑛)). 

(6) 

There are different types of copula families, for example, Gaussian, Archimedean, Product, 
etc and they behave in a different manner in the tail part of the distribution. Compared to the other 
traditional multivariate, elliptical, Archimedean copulas, and vine copulas (VC) are more flexible 
to  capture  the  inherent  dependency.  Under  some  certain  regularity  conditions  it’s  possible  to 
express the 𝑛 −dimensional multivariate copula mentioned in the Equation (6) as multiplication 
of pair-copulas [ (Aas, Czado, Frigessi, & Bakken, 2009)] in the following iterative approach. For 
𝑛 = 2 the bi-variate probability density function (BPDF) is: 

(7) 
𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2) = 𝑓12(𝑥1|𝑥2) ⋅ 𝑓2(𝑥2) = 𝑐12(𝐹1(𝑥1), 𝐹2(𝑥2)) ⋅ 𝑓1(𝑥1) ⋅ 𝑓2(𝑥2). 
 In the Equation (7) 𝑐12(. , . ) is the applicable pair-copula density function (PCDF) for 𝐹1(𝑥1) and 
𝐹2(𝑥2). For 𝑛 = 3 the tri-variate probability density function (TPDF) is: 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3) = 𝑓123(𝑥1|𝑥2, 𝑥3) ⋅ 𝑓23(𝑥2|𝑥3) ⋅ 𝑓3(𝑥3)
= 𝑐12(𝐹1(𝑥1), 𝐹2(𝑥2)) ⋅ 𝑐23(𝐹2(𝑥2), 𝐹3(𝑥3))
⋅ 𝑐13|2(𝐹(𝑥1|𝑥2), 𝐹(𝑥3|𝑥2)) ⋅ 𝑓1(𝑥1) ⋅ 𝑓2(𝑥2) ⋅ 𝑓3(𝑥3).
 In  Equation  (8) 𝑐23(. , . ), 𝑐13|2(. , . ) are  the  applicable  PCDF  and  conditional  PCDF  (CPCDF) 
respectively. Likewise, for 𝑛 = 4 the four-variate probability density function (FPDF) is: 

(8) 

𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑥4) = 𝑓4123(𝑥4|𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3) ⋅ 𝑓312(𝑥3|𝑥1, 𝑥2) ⋅
𝑓21(𝑥2|𝑥1) ⋅ 𝑓1(𝑥1) = 𝑐12(𝐹1(𝑥1), 𝐹2(𝑥2)) ⋅
𝑐13(𝐹1(𝑥1), 𝐹3(𝑥3)) ⋅ 𝑐14(𝐹1(𝑥1), 𝐹4(𝑥4)) ⋅
𝑐23|1(𝐹(𝑥2|𝑥1), 𝐹(𝑥3|𝑥1)) ⋅ 𝑐24|1(𝐹(𝑥2|𝑥1), 𝐹(𝑥4|𝑥1)) ⋅
𝑐34|2(𝐹(𝑥3|𝑥2), 𝐹(𝑥4|𝑥2)) ⋅ 𝑓1(𝑥1) ⋅ 𝑓2(𝑥2) ⋅ 𝑓3(𝑥3) ⋅ 𝑓4(𝑥4)
 VC  is  a  graphical  approach  representing  an  𝑛 -dimensional  multivariate  PDF  (MPDF)  using 
𝑛.(𝑛−1)
 suitable PCDF in a hierarchical manner where the dependence structures of (𝑛 − 1) have 
unconditional PCDF and that of the remaining has conditional PCPDF (CPCDF). In this paper, we 
focus on C-Vine Copula (C-VC), because of its better flexibility.

   A C-VC with 4-variables has 3 trees, 𝑇𝑗 and each tree, 𝑇𝑗 has 4 − 𝑗 + 1 nodes and 4 − 𝑗 
edges  where 𝑗 = 1,2,3 like  Figure  (1).  In  tree 𝑇1  each  edge  between  two  nodes  represent  the 
PCDF. From Figure (1) in tree 𝑇2 the edges between each node is CPCDF where 𝑐13|4 denotes the 
CPCDF of the first and third variable given the fourth variable and 𝑐23|4 represents the CPCDF of 
the second and third variable given the fourth variable. In the tree 𝑇3 each node is connected by an 
edge  representing  CPCDF  (Figure  (1)  )  of  the  first  and  second  variable  given  third  and  fourth 
variable where 𝐶12|34 = 𝐹(𝑥1, 𝑥2|𝑥3, 𝑥4). 

2.3  Spatial Interpolation 
 In this section we propose two novel spatial interpolation approaches combining spatial 
clustering, knowledge of copula and C-VC assuming the directional stationarity of data is defined 
in the following:  

2.3.1  Spatial Copula Estimation 
 Let 𝒮 be the spatial domain of interest for the spatial interpolation purpose. This spatial 
clustering technique is established upon the distance and degree of similarity between two spatial 
points. Hierarchical spatial clustering (HSC) is performed using the complete linkage method [ 
(Hubert, 1974)], cutoff values of Haversine distance (HD) [ (Gade, 2010)] and auto-correlation 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between  each  pair  of  points.  Here,  the  number  of  HSC  and  HSC’s  radius  are  the  two  most 
important parameters. According to the principle of HSC, it is obvious that the sum of squares 
within  a  cluster  (SSW)  should  be  lesser  than  the  sum  of  squares  between  the  clusters  (SSB). 
Making use of the Elbow method while the SSW reaches a plateau, we will consider that is the 
optimal number of HSC and to determine HSC’s radius arranging HSC’s height in ascending order, 
that considers a significant height as a HSC’s radius. Therefore, in this context, we can think of 
the HSC as a spatial field defined in the following Equation (10) 

𝑁𝑖 = {(𝑜𝑏𝑖1, 𝑜𝑏𝑖2): 𝐻𝐷(𝑜𝑏𝑖1, 𝑜𝑏𝑖2) ≤ 𝐻𝐷𝑐𝑢𝑡  &  𝜌(||𝑜𝑏𝑖1 − 𝑜𝑏𝑖2||) ≥ 𝑟𝑐𝑢𝑡  &  𝑖1 ≠ 𝑖2}
⋃ {(𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑗, 𝑦𝑖𝑗) : 𝐻𝐷(𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑗, 𝑦𝑖𝑗) ≤ 𝐻𝐷𝑐𝑢𝑡  &  𝜌(||𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑗 − 𝑦𝑖𝑗||) ≥ 𝑟𝑐𝑢𝑡}

(10) 

Let 𝑁1, 𝑁2, . . . , 𝑁𝑘  be  the 𝑘 clusters, 𝑦𝑖𝑗  be  the 𝑗𝑡ℎ unobserved  point,  and 𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑗  be  the 𝑗𝑡ℎ 
observed point of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ HSC where, 𝑗 = 1,2, . . . , 𝑛𝑖; 𝑖 = 1,2,3, . . . , 𝑘 where 𝑛𝑖 be the number of 
the  unobserved  points  in 𝑖𝑡ℎ HSC  and 𝑐𝑖,  the  centre  of 𝑖𝑡ℎ cluster.  A  threeshold  HD  (𝐻𝐷𝑐𝑢𝑡)  is 
chosen ∋ 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑐𝑖, 𝑦𝑖𝑗) ≤ 𝐻𝐷𝑐𝑢𝑡 that is surrounding the centre of each HSC, a circle is constructed 
with radius of 𝐻𝐷𝑐𝑢𝑡 units and 𝑟𝑐𝑢𝑡 refers the spatial auto correlation cutoff to maintain the spatial 
continuity of HSC. For 𝑘 clusters maximum number of distinct spatial regions (SR) is 2𝑘 − 1. Let 
𝑣⃗ be  the  presence  vector  of  all  unobserved  points 𝑦𝑖𝑗 = (𝑙𝑜𝑛, 𝑙𝑎𝑡),  where 𝑙𝑜𝑛 and 𝑙𝑎𝑡 stand  for 
longitude and latitude of an unobserved point respectively. Now, we create a linear map in the 
following:  

𝑓: ℛ2×1 → ℛ𝑘×1 ⇒ 𝑓(𝑦𝑖𝑗) = 𝑣⃗ 

(11) 

 In the Equation (11) 𝑣⃗ is a binary vector of length 𝑘, where 𝑣⃗ = [𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑘] 

1  𝑖𝑓   (𝑙𝑜𝑛, 𝑙𝑎𝑡) ∈ 𝐶𝑙
0  𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒   

𝑣𝑙 = {
where 𝑙 = 1,2,3, . . . , 𝑘. The maximum number of presence vectors for 𝑘 clusters is 2𝑘 − 1. 
As a result, we obtain at most 2𝑘 − 1 distinct SR in our entire study area. Let 𝑅1, 𝑅2, . . . , 𝑅𝑚 be the 
𝑚  SR  where  𝑚 ≤ 2𝑘 − 1 .  Let  𝑣𝑖 = 0  ∀  𝑖 = 1,2, . . . , (𝑖 − 1), (𝑖 + 1), . . . , 𝑘  and  𝑣𝑖 = 1  that 
denotes 𝑦𝑖𝑗 is inside 𝑁𝑖 only.

Clustering of the Spatial Field 

Figure  2: (a) The entire spatial domain, Delhi is divided into four clusters and the 
corresponding monitoring stations. 

(b) The entire geographical area is split up into some disjoint regions which are shaded by 

different colour and the corresponding observed points belonging into each region.  

  In Figure (2 a) we divide the entire spatial domain into some HSC grounded on the HD 
of monitoring stations and degree of homogeneity where each circle denotes a HSC, and the dotted 
points represent the observed monitoring stations contained in that HSC. As a result, the whole 
area is split into some disjoint SR and the dotted points represent the monitoring stations, included 
in that SR (Figure (2 b)) are salient points to interpolate along the surface of each SR.

Utilizing the concept of copula, we transform a HSC to a spatial random field (SRF) to 
predict the values on the unobserved location. Therefore, we first concentrate on the univariate 
marginal probability distribution (MDF) of inclusion of the latitude (𝜔𝑖) and longitude (𝛽𝑖) of an 
observed  location  being  included  in  𝑅𝑖  separately.  The  corresponding  MDF  are  respectively 
𝑃({𝜔: 𝜔 ∈ 𝑅𝑖}) and 𝑃({𝛽: 𝛽 ∈ 𝑅𝑖}). Using the concept of copula, we have created the Bi-variate 
probability distribution function (BDF) of inclusion of latitude and longitude in the 𝑖𝑡ℎ SR, and 
Kendall’s 𝜏 is considered as the measure of association between two RVs. So, the joint BDF is as 
follows:  

𝐻(𝑥1, 𝑥2) = 𝐶(𝐹𝜔(𝑋1𝜔), 𝐹𝛽(𝑋2𝛽)) where 𝐶: [0,1]2 → [0,1]. 
To evaluate the CDF of that spatial random process (SRP), a composite function of two 

RVs i.e., 

𝑌(. , . ) ≡ {𝑌(𝜔, 𝛽): 𝜔 ∈ 𝑅𝑖, 𝛽 ∈ 𝑅𝑖} we implement the KDE to get the MDF of 𝑌 i.e., 𝐹(𝑦) 
and making use of copula we deduce the joint Tri-variate probability distribution (TDF) as follows:  

𝐻(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑦) = 𝐶(𝐹𝜔(𝑋1𝜔), 𝐹𝛽(𝑋2𝛽), 𝐹(𝑌)) where 𝐶: [0,1]3 → [0,1]. 
After getting, the BDF (𝐻(𝑥1, 𝑥2)) and TDF (𝐻(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑦)) using copula we find out the 

conditional PDF (CPDF) defined in the following two equations: 

𝑓(𝑦1|𝑥1, 𝑥2) =

𝜕3𝐻(𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑦)
𝜕𝑥1𝜕𝑥2,𝜕𝑦
𝜕2𝐻(𝑥1,𝑥2)
𝜕𝑥1𝜕𝑥2

(12) 

 Here,  we  assume  two  RVs,  latitude  ( 𝑋1 )  and  longitude  ( 𝑋2 )  follow  Uniform[ 𝑎1, 𝑏1 ]  and 
Uniform[𝑎2, 𝑏2]  respectively.  Now  we  generate  random  points (𝑥1, 𝑥2) along, 𝒮 to  measure  the 
CDF of SRP i.e., 𝑌(𝑥1, 𝑥2) having different CDF for each geographical position. Since, there are 
some missing data, we use EM algorithm to estimate the parameter at the time of fitting MDF. 
Applying copula we get the joint TDF of 𝑌(𝑥1, 𝑥2), 𝑋1, 𝑋2 is defined as 𝐹(𝑦, 𝑥1, 𝑥2). Next, we will 
introduce  the  HSC-based  SI  that  Spatial  Copula  interpolation  (SC).  Therefore,  we  split 𝒮 in 𝑚 
number of regions making use of the HSC algorithm, discussed earlier. Let’s consider, 𝑅1 has three 
observed locations 𝑜𝑏1, 𝑜𝑏2, 𝑜𝑏3. In that region we can generate a number of gridded points not 
necessarily  of uniform  size, out  of those unobserved points we consider one unobserved point, 
𝑗  which is the 𝑗𝑡ℎ point in 𝑅1. Applying the conditional copula (from Equation (12)) 
defined as 𝑢𝑛𝑅1
we establish the conditional copula based probability distribution function (CCDF) for each un-
observed point in a SR i.e. 𝐹

𝑗 (𝑦).

(13) 

 From the Equation (13) we get the CCDF of 𝑗𝑡ℎ un-observed point included in the first SR. That 
lets us calculate the CCDF of SRP, 𝑌 at the unobserved centroid of a cluster and making the use 
of CCDF we can calculate conditional copula based probability density function (CCPDF). The 
mathematical formulation is described in the following:

= ∑𝑖∈𝑅1 𝛼𝑖𝑗 ⋅ 𝑓𝑜𝑏𝑖(𝑦|𝑥1, 𝑥2)
𝑗 (𝑦) = ∑𝑖∈𝑅1 𝛼𝑖𝑗 ⋅ 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑦𝑓𝑜𝑏𝑖(𝑦|𝑥1, 𝑥2)

𝑢𝑛𝑅1

(14) 
 In the Equation (14) the weights are defined as 𝛼𝑖𝑗. This weights are the proportional to the spatial 
auto  correlation  function  (ACF)  but  inversely  proportional  to  the  degree  of  separation.  So  the 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
required 𝛼𝑖𝑗 is defined in the following assuming the fact that, 𝑜𝑏𝑖, 𝑢𝑛𝑗 ∈ 𝑅1  

𝛼𝑖𝑗 =

𝑑𝑖𝑗⋅𝜌(||𝑜𝑏𝑖−𝑢𝑛𝑗||)
∑𝑖∈𝑅1 𝑑𝑖𝑗⋅𝜌(||𝑜𝑏𝑖−𝑢𝑛𝑗||)

(15) 

 In the Equation (15) 𝑑𝑖𝑗 is the degree of seperation established upon the HD and the degree of 
departure of two PDFs defined on the SRF in the following Equation (16)

specifying  modified  gaussian  distance  kernel  and  here,  as  a  distance  we  apply  the  degree  of 
separation between two conditional copula based spatial probability density function (CCSPDF) 
to capture the probabilistic spatial dissimilarity, and the last part is HD. For 𝜌(||𝑜𝑏𝑖 − 𝑢𝑛𝑗||) in 
the Equation (15) choice of suitable covariance function is necessary. Therefore, we choose the 
suitable  covariance  function  among  well-defined  variogram  clouds,  for  example,  Exponential, 
Gaussian and Spherical, [ (Cressie, 2015)] etc. Applying this concept we adopt the Algorithm (1) 
to interpolate over the entire spatial surface:

2.3.2  Spatial Bayesian Vine-Copula Estimation 
 In  this  section,  we  introduce  spatial  vine  copula  estimation  based  upon  the  Bayesian 
statistical  approach  (SBVC).  Under  the  square  error  loss  function  employing  MHA  we  do  the 
posterior estimate of the parameter in the following way:  

𝜋(𝜃⃗) =

𝑓𝑋1,𝑋2|𝑋3,𝑋4(𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3,𝑥4|𝜃⃗⃗⃗)⋅𝑝(𝜃⃗⃗⃗)
∫ 𝑓𝑋1,𝑋2|𝑋3,𝑋4(𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3,𝑥4|𝜃⃗⃗⃗)⋅𝑝(𝜃⃗⃗⃗)𝑑𝜃⃗⃗⃗ 
In the Equation (17) 𝑓(. |. ) defines the conditional copula based PDF (CCPDF) derived 
making use the inherited concept of Figure (1), 𝑝(𝜃⃗) denotes the prior PDF of 𝜃⃗ and 𝜋(𝜃⃗) defines 
the posterior PDF (PPDF) of 𝜃⃗. Using the PPDF we’ll calculate the posterior estimation of 𝜃⃗ under 
the absolute error loss function. After getting the most updated values 𝜃⃗ using MHA we find out 
the conditional bayesian prediction of two variables in the following: 

(17) 

|𝑋1, 𝑋2, 𝑋3, 𝑋4) = ∫ 𝜃⃗ ⋅ 𝜋(𝜃⃗)𝑑𝜃⃗

𝐸(𝜃⃗̂
𝐸(𝑋1, 𝑋2|𝑋3, 𝑋4) = ∫ ∫ 𝑥1 ⋅ 𝑥2 ⋅ 𝑓𝑋1,𝑋2|𝑋3,𝑋4(𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, 𝑥4|𝜃⃗̂

)𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥2

(18) 

Using this Equation (18) we can easily spatially interpolate the target variables on target 
locations. Here, we consider two SRPs those are, 𝑌1(𝑥1, 𝑥2) and 𝑌2(𝑥1, 𝑥2) and apply the concept 
of tail-dependency of a bi-variate copula to measure their hidden reliance. Utilizing VC we find 
the  CCPDF  i.e.,  𝐹(𝑦1, 𝑦2|𝑥1, 𝑥2; 𝜃⃗) = 𝑃[𝑌1(𝑥1, 𝑥2) ≤ 𝑦1, 𝑌2(𝑥1, 𝑥2) ≤ 𝑦2|𝑋1 = 𝑥1, 𝑋2 = 𝑥2; 𝜃⃗] . 
Regarding parameter estimation, during fitting MDF, we use UMVUE, EM etc, but to estimate the 
parameter of the copula family we only consider the posterior estimate. Then using the conditional 
expectation technique we estimate the 𝑌1  &  𝑌2 values all the randomly generated gridded points 
and interpolate the values.  

2.4  Model validation 
 The accuracy of the models are validated by the following three methods where, 𝑌(𝑠⃗𝑖) is 

the observed data points and, 𝑌̂(𝑠⃗𝑖) is the predicted value: 

 1.  Mean of Absolute Error (MAE) 

𝑀𝐴𝐸 =

2.  Root of Mean Square Error (RMSE) 

∑𝑛
𝑖=1 |𝑌(𝑠⃗𝑖)−𝑌̂(𝑠⃗𝑖)|
𝑛

𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 = √∑𝑛

𝑖=1 (𝑌(𝑠⃗𝑖)−𝑌̂(𝑠⃗𝑖))2
𝑛

(19) 

(20) 

 3.  K-fold CV 
 Then, using Equation (20), (19) we measure the accuracy of the proposed model. K-fold 
CV is carried out assuming K as 10. The 10-folded CV indicates that the data set is divided into 
the 10 random sub-sets, and among these data sets, 9 sub-sets are taken as training data set, and 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the rest 1 is taken as a test data set which is termed as one-leave-one out CV (OLOCV). It helps 
compare the MAE of proposed and old models  

3  Study area and Data 
To demonstrate the SC, SBVC, and to compare with OK we take Delhi-air pollution as a 

circumstance study. Delhi, the capital of India is the most polluted due to, rapid urbanization, 
boosting amounts of traffic, increasing population, and energy consumption at an alarming level. 
Sometimes, the level of PM 2.5 concentration in air has reached up to 999 𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 [ (Mukherjee, 
et al., 2018)] and, among all other air pollutants, it affects public health [ (Zheng, Pozzer, Cao, & 
Lelieveld, 2015)] badly. Boosting levels of automobiles, cars, etc cause higher pollutant 
concentrations in the air [ (Samal, Gupta, Pathania, Mohan, & Suresh, 2013)]. We look at the air 
pollution data collected by the monitoring stations, maintained by the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), and the Indian Institute of Tropical 
Meteorology (IITM). To get the research goal, we collected data on several air pollutants, such 
as PM 2.5, PM 10, NO, NO 2, NO 𝑥 and wind direction (WD), from the CPCB websites. To map 
the Spatio-temporal distribution of air quality and deduce the effect of WD on the air pollution in 
Delhi, these data play an important role. The data were collected over 24 hours, and the period 
was taken from 1𝑠𝑡 February 2017 to 31𝑠𝑡 December 2021. The Figure (4) depicts the temporal 
variability of daily PM 2.5 emission which is cyclic in nature after a fixed time stand. There is 
always a higher concentration witnessed from almost the end of November to the end of 
December (Figure (4)) around 400𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 and sometimes it grows up to 800𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 which is 
very much alarming for the human life, primarily during winter due to burning of firecrackers, 
agricultural crop burning, etc.  

PM 𝟐.𝟓 concentration over the whole spatial surface 

Figure  3: The interpolated PM 2.5 values of November in the year, 2019 

   There are 38 monitoring stations in this data set, as shown in Figure (2 B). According to 
Figure (3), we detect that the Northern part of Delhi is very much sensitive to pollution whereas 
the Central, East, and West parts of Delhi are less sensitive regarding the pollutant concentrations 
in the air. According to Figure (3), the PM 2.5 concentration in the Northern part of Delhi can reach 
up to 220𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 whereas in the Central, East, and West part of Delhi that is limited into 190 to 
200 𝜇𝑔/𝑚3. As a result, the Spatio-temporal variability in air pollutant concentrations is visible. 

12 

 
 
  
 
However, there are two shortcomings to applying spatial interpolation techniques to interpolate (i) 
the Delhi NCR region is far away from other monitoring stations in Delhi, (ii) The missing Data.  
Temporal Variability of PM 𝟐.𝟓

Histogram of daily PM 𝟐.𝟓 emission 

Figure  5: The Histogram of daily PM 2.5 emission from 1𝑠𝑡 Feburary, 2017 to 31𝑠𝑡 December, 
2021 in the study area, Delhi. 

   We can easily conclude from the Figure (5) that the observed frequency distribution of 
daily PM 2.5 emission during this period is positively skewed which gives an idea of how to fit the 
positively skewed distribution such as log-Normal, Gamma, Exponential, Weibull, etc depending 
upon  the  tail  distribution.  Precisely  there  is  a  higher  concentration  in  the  interval  from 30 −
40𝜇𝑔/𝑚3. Figure (6) provides a brief overview of the variability and a five-point summary of the 
pollutants  and  WD  which  establishes  the  fact  that  PM 10  and  PM 2.5  have  higher  variability 
compared to other pollutants and the variance of WD also sensitive.

4  Results and Discussion 

 This section goes over how to compare two new models, SC and SBVC to other well-

known spatial models step by step. Following that, we will attempt to provide a brief overview of 
pollutant  concentrations  in  the  future,  as  well  as  discuss  how  an  important  meteorological 
parameter can affect pollution concentrations mathematically.

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
     
based on the AIC, BIC value, and KS test statistic value in Figure (7 a). Because the empirical 
PDF is positively skewed, we only consider well-known positively skewed distributions such as 
Weibull, Log-normal (LN), Gamma, and Exponential distributions, and Table (1) shows that the 
LN  distribution  is  suitable  to  fit  based  on  the  lowest  AIC,  BIC,  and  KS  test  statistic  value. 
Similarly, we fit the circular family distributions on WD and discover that the VM distribution is 
the best PDF to fit.

  The  next  step  is  to  estimate  the  parameter  of  the  MDF.  We  already  discussed  the 
disadvantages of using MLE to estimate the parameter in Section (2.1). As a result, we can use the 
EM algorithm to obtain the updated shape and scale parameters of the LN distribution. We discuss 
how the LogLik value converges to a fixed value after a certain number of iterations in Figure (8). 
The required number of iterations for the EM algorithm in this case study is 223, after which the 
difference between the two LogLik values is negligible. Figure (7 b) depicts how the PM 2.5 value 
varies with respect to latitude and longitude. While the Longitude (Lon) ranges from 77.0 to 77.1 
and  the  Latitude  (Lat)  varies,  from 28.5 to 28.6,  the  PM 2.5 concentration  is  generally  within 
100 − 150𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 but if Lon varies from 77.15 to 77.3, the PM 2.5 concentration becomes high 
and it ranges from 150 − 200𝜇𝑔/𝑚3. Similarly, while Lat is varying from 28.6 − 28.7 then the 
most spatial variability of PM 2.5 is detected in every interval of Lon and sometimes reaches up to 
300𝜇𝑔/𝑚3  while  the  Lat  varies  from  28.7 − 28.8 the  spatial  variation  is  identified  and  the 
variation of PM 2.5 is almost lying between 200 − 250𝜇𝑔/𝑚3.  

Figure  8: The convergence of the Log-Likelihood value after updating the value of the 
parameters in each iteration using EM algorithm. 

   However,  during  fitting  VM  distribution  we  use  the  concept  of  UMVUE  which  is 

16 

 
 
 
 
  
mentioned in the Theorem (2.1) in the Section (2.1) to get the shape and scale parameter of the 
VM distribution with better accuracy. In the following Table (2) we discuss the shape and scale 
parameters of LN and VM PDF and corresponding the last updated LogLik values.

   Our  goal  now  is  to  run  the  two  novel  spatial  interpolation  algorithms  mentioned  in 
Sections (2.3.1) and Section (2.3.2) and compare them to other spatial interpolation approaches. 
Using the threshold criteria mentioned in Section (2.3.1) we divide the entire spatial domain into 
4 HSC and consider the cutoff radius is 18026m as shown in Figure (9 a).  

Optimal number of HSC and optimal HSC size

In Figure (9 (A)) of the cluster dendrogram, the height represents the HD, and in Figure (9 (B)) we 
plot  SSW  along  the  Y-axis  and  the  optimal  number  of  HSC  along  the  X-axis.  The  following 
discussion focuses on the tail dependence of two RVs, as shown in Figure (10). These two RVs in 
this case study are PM 2.5 and WD.  

Tail-dependency and Joint-CDF 

Figure  10: In the (left) part the discussion regarding the lower tail and upper tail dependency of 
two RV and in the (right) part the joint CDF of two RV. 

   The  upper  tail  dependence  and  lower  tail  dependence  between  two  RVs,  X  and  Y  is 

defined in the following:   

𝑑𝑢 = lim
𝑢→1
𝑑𝑙 = lim
𝑢→0

𝑃[𝑌 ≥ 𝐹𝑦

−1(𝑢)|𝑋 ≥ 𝐹𝑥

𝑃[𝑌 ≤ 𝐹𝑦

−1(𝑢)|𝑋 ≤ 𝐹𝑥

−1(𝑢)] = lim
𝑢→1
−1(𝑢)] = lim

(21) 

The  Equation  (21)  shows  the  behaviour  of  one  RV  while  othe  one  converging  to  the  extreme 
values. We can conclude from this Figure (10) left that after 0.8 the upper tail of their distributions 
is independent and lesser than 0.1, the lower tail of their distributions is independent. As a result, 
we can say that higher values of PM 2.5 concentration are unaffected by WD because there is a 
very low concentration at that point but where the marginal PDF of PM 2.5 is moderate, there is a 
significant tail dependence on WD. The joint CDF of PM 2.5 and WD is plotted in the Figure (10) 
on right applying 𝐵𝑖𝐶𝑜𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡() function in R, where the fitted copula is Rotated Twan Type-2 
Copula with estimated Kendall’s 𝜏 = 0.1341 and the LogLik value is −1.204 which is the highest 
of any copula family, including GC, t-Copula, Frank, Clayton, Joe, and so on. We want to use our 
novel copula-based spatial interpolation algorithm (SC) in a Bayesian framework after fitting the 
copula using 𝐶𝐷𝑉𝑖𝑛𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑑𝐹𝑖𝑡() function in R. The posterior distribution and posterior estimate 
of the parameter are critical in this context. MHA is used in this context to obtain the posterior 
estimate of the parameters.

   According  to  this  Figure  (11)  we  use  the  concept  of  Bayesian  Inference  to  give  the 
posterior  estimate,  assuming  that  the  parameter  prior  distributions  are  uniform  and  truncated 
normal distributions. Following that, we use MHA to obtain the posterior estimate under the MSE 
loss function, which is 0.04898261 (from Figure (11 a)) and −13.61893 (from Figure (11 b)), 
respectively. The rate of convergence of two parameters is plotted in the Figure (11), depicting 
that the rate of convergence of parameter 1 is faster than that of Parameter 2. Now we will look at 
how WD and spatial clustering affect the variance of PM 2.5 in Table (3) and the Figure (15).

As  a  result,  in  the  two-way  analysis  of  the  variance  model  (Two  way  ANOVA),  we

consider PM 2.5 as a dependent variable and WD and clusters as independent variables. Along with 
the columns of Table (3), we represent Treatments, Degrees of freedom (Df), Sum of square (SS), 
Mean Square (MS), F-Ratio, and P-value, and along the rows, we represent WD, Cluster, their 
interaction effect, and residuals. We can see from Table (3) that there is a significant impact of 
WD and clustering on PM 2.5 emission at the 0.05 level of significance. However, the interaction 
effect of WD and Clusters has no significant impact on PM 2.5 emission. To aid comprehension, 
we present a graphical representation of these ANOVA tables in Figure (15) in Section (6.3) where 
WD  is  represented  along  the  X-axis,  PM 2.5 is  represented  along  the  Y-axis,  and  each  spatial 
cluster is used as a panel. In the SC interpolation method, we investigate another factor, spatial 
ACF, which is employed as an important weight to counteract spatial variability across all lags.  

Figure  12: Spatial ACF corresponding to every spatial lag, we plot the lag distance along the X-
axis and the ACF along the Y-axis. 

   As a result, in the Figure (12), we investigate how the ACF varies with respect to the 
spatial lag. In this Figure (12), we notice that the value of ACF is comparatively higher for nearby 
stations than for stations further away, and we use the blue shaded region to give a brief idea of 
the interval of variation of ACF values. In this case study the fitted variogram model is Matern 
variogram model with nugget: 0; sill: 617; range: 0.02 and kappa: 0.09. Utilizing this value and 
the other distance weights in the Equation (14) we calculate CCPDF in every unobserved location. 
In this case study, we assume that 𝜖 is 0.4224 and 𝑝 = 2 in the Equation (14) .  

The entire framework is now ready to execute the new spatial copula interpolation (SC) 
described  in  Section  (2.3.1)  and  Bayesian  Spatial-Vine  Copula  (SBVC)  described  in  Section 
(2.3.2). As a result, we create an SRF within each HSC and focus on the spatial region between 
them. For SC, we assume that Lat and Lon have a bi-variate uniform distribution, and PM 2.5 has 
a  LN  distribution,  and  the  suitable  copula  is  Clayton  Copula  among  other  copula  familes  like, 
Gauusian, t-copula, archimedian-copulas, based  on  AIC, BIC, and  LogLik  values, to  find their 
joint CDF using 𝑚𝑣𝑑𝑐() function in R, with a parameter of 0.01697 and a dimension of 3. Then, 
using the Equation (22), we obtain the required CCDF.

 Using the Equation (14), (15), and (16) we get the CCPDF of each unobserved location. Then 
using the Algorithm (1) we get the interpolated values.  

Spatial Interpolation 

Figure  13: Spatial Interpolation of PM 2.5 during the month of November, in 2019, 2020 and 
2021. In Top the spatial interpolation technique SC is used and in below the SBVC algorithm is 
used as a spatial interpolation algorithm. Along X-axis we plot Longitude, along Y-axis we plot 
latitude and along the whole surface we plot the PM 2.5. 

   In the Figure (13) we plot the monthly PM 2.5 emission during the month of November 
for the three years, 2019, 2020, and 2021. According to this Figure (13) we detect that using SC 
in  November,  2019,  the  PM 2.5 emission  varies  from 180 − 220𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 whereas  using  SBVC 
ranges from 120 − 280𝜇𝑔/𝑚3 (Figure (13)), similar patterns are observed in the year 2020 and 
2021 as well. If we carefully examine Figure (13) carefully we can look that the variation of SBVC 
is  greater  than  that  of  SC  and  the  Northern  and  South-East  part  of  Delhi  is  highly  sensitive  to 
pollution. We notice that in the western part of Delhi the SBVC is too effective to show the strong 
spatial trend, as a result the PM 2.5 emission is random in nature (Figure (13)). We investigate the 

21 

 
 
 
  
 
relationship between the observed and predicted values of three methods: SC, SBVC, and OK in 
the Figure (14 (Top)), and we discover that there is a strong relationship between the observed and 
predicted values in SC, followed by SBVC, and finally OK. As a result, we can make the critical 
observation that the power of explainable variation in SC is greater than SBVC, which is better 
than OK. It is clear that, the measurement error, MAE and RMSE of SC is lesser than SBVC, and 
lastly OK as demonstrated by Figure (14 (Bottom)). 

Although  the  SC  method  outperforms  the  other  two,  there  are  some  areas  where 
improvements are possible, such as: (i) When clustering, we assume that the rate of inclusion of 
geo-spatial points in a cluster is constant, but this can vary in practice. (ii) we ignore the effect of 
extreme  values  during  interpolation;  (iii)  we  use  the  concept  of  degree  of  departure  of 
characteristics between observed and unobserved points and spatial continuity concurrently, but it 
sometimes contradicts the concept of spatial continuity; and (iv) we do not pay enough attention 
to  the  data  set’s  temporal  stationarity;  (v)  to  estimate  the  parameter  of  copula,  applying  EM 
algorithm.  SBVC  accepts  the  same  drawbacks,  but  one  additional  drawback  is  that  when 
determining spatial trend, but it is sometimes ineffective to explore.

5  Conclusion 
 The introduced SC and SBVC are extensions of the previous spatial copula-based models 
that address issues such as bin selection, the use of MLE to estimate the parameter in missing data 
sets, and so on. When compared to other geo-statistical models, the entire SC and SBVC are very 
effective and provide nearly accurate results (from Figure (14 (Bottom))). This SC model produces 
better results for specially skewed spatial random fields and provides a mathematical argument for 
selecting  important  covariates.  This  study  provides  an  idea  of  alternative  distance  weights  and 
distance functions that are very effective in capturing spatial variation. A temporal extension of 
this algorithm is possible, which motivates further research. This model is explained in this study 
using a real-world data set of PM 2.5 concentrations in the air, but this algorithm can be used in 
other scenarios such as mining, temperature modeling, meteorological modeling, and so on. This 
algorithm may be more advantageous than other spatial estimation models because it makes no 
assumptions about gaussian distribution, stationarity, dynamic behavior, or skewed data sets.

6.1  Proof of Theorem (2.1) 

Proof. If 𝑋 ∼ 𝑉𝑀(𝑘, 𝜇) then we know the corresponding charachteristic function of 𝑋 is 

𝜙𝑛(𝑥) = 𝐸[𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑥] 

𝑑𝑥

(23) 

 In the Equation (23) the term 𝐼𝑛(𝑘) =

. In Equation (23) putting 𝑛 = 1 we get,  

 and putting 𝑛 = −1 we get,  

 Adding and subtracting Equation (24) and Equation (25) we get  

𝐸(𝑒−𝑖𝑥) =

) = 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜇

(24) 

(25) 

(26) 

 Therefore, from the Equation (26) the statistic 𝑇1(𝑥) =
unbiased estimators of 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜇 and 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜇 respectively. 

𝐼0(𝑘)⋅𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥)
𝐼1(𝑘)

 and 𝑇2(𝑥) =

𝐼0(𝑘)⋅𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)
𝐼1(𝑘)

 are the 

Here, the PDF of 𝑋 is denoted as 𝑓(𝑥) and the parameter space is defined as Φ and support 

is defined as 𝒳.  

𝑓(𝑥) =

𝑒𝑘⋅𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥−𝜇)
2𝜋⋅𝐼0(𝑘)

= 𝑒𝑥𝑝[𝑘 ⋅ 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥 − 𝜇) − 𝑙𝑜𝑔(2𝜋𝐼0(𝑘))]
= 𝑒𝑥𝑝[𝑘 ⋅ 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜇) + 𝑘 ⋅ 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜇) − 𝑙𝑜𝑔(2𝜋) − 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐼0(𝑘))]
 From the Equation (27) we write the likelihood function as product of two terms moreover this 
VM distribution satisfying the following properties: 

(27)

    1.  𝒳 is [0,2𝜋] therefore, it is independent upon the parameter.  
    2.  Φ = {(𝜇, 𝑘): 𝜇 ∈ ℛ; 𝑘 > 0} which indicating it is an open interval.  
    3.  Here {1, 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥), 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)} and {1, 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜇), 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜇)} are Linearly Independent (LIN).  
 Therefore, we tell that the PDF is belonging Two-PEF. Therefore, 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) and 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥) are 
complete and sufficient statistic of 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜇) and 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜇). Using Lehmann-Scheffe Theorem they are 
the UMVUE. Moreover, using Equation (23) replacing 𝑛 = 2 we get  

𝐸[𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝑥] =
