Abstract—Objective-The main purpose of this paper is to construct 
a distributed clustering algorithm such that each distributed cluster 
can perform the data accuracy at their respective cluster head node 
before  data  aggregation  and  transmit  the  data  to  the  sink  node. 
Design  approach/Procedure  –  We  investigate  that  the  data  are 
spatially  correlated  among  the  sensor  nodes  which  form  the 
clusters  in  the  spatial  domain.  Due  to  high  correlation  of  data, 
these clusters of sensor nodes are overlapped in the spatial domain. 
To  overcome  this  problem,  we  construct  a  distributed  clustering 
algorithm  with  non-overlapping  irregular  clusters  in  the  spatial 
domain. Then each distributed cluster can perform data accuracy at 
the  cluster  head  node  and  finally  send  the  data  to  the  sink  node. 
Findings-  Simulation  result  shows  the  associate  sensor  nodes  of 
each distributed cluster and clarifies their data accuracy profile in 
the  spatial  domain.  We  demonstrate  the  simulation  results  for  a 
single  cluster  to  verify  that  their  exist  an  optimal  cluster  which 
give  approximately  the  same  data  accuracy  level  achieve  by  the 
single  cluster.  Moreover  we  find  that  as  the  distance  from  the 
tracing  point  to  the  number  of  sensor  node  increases  the  data 
accuracy  decreases.  Design  Limitations  –  This  model  is  only 
applicable to estimate data accuracy for distributed clusters where 
the  sensed  data  are  assumed  to  be  spatially  correlated  with 
approximately  same  variations.  Practical 
implementation  – 
Measure  the  moisture  content  in  the  distributed  agricultural  field. 
Inventive/Novel  idea-  This  is  the  first  time  that  a  data  accuracy 
model  is  performed  for  the  distributed  clusters  before  data 
aggregation  at  the  cluster  head  node  which  can  reduce  data

 INTRODUCTION  

    Wireless  sensor  network  has  made  a  drastic  change  in 
communications  for  the  last  several  years.  One  of  the  vital 
tasks of wireless sensor network is to sense or measure the 
physical  phenomenon  of  data  such  as  measurement  of 
humidity, 
the 
temperature,  seismic  event  etc 
environment [1]. Physical phenomenon of data is measured 
or sense by a device called sensor nodes which are capable 
to sense, process and communicate the data through out the 
network. Since  most of the data are spatially correlated [2] 
among  them,  the  sensor  nodes  form  clusters  in  the  sensor 
field  to  reduce  data  collection  cost  [3].  According  to 
literature  survey,  LEACH  [4]  gives  a  clear  idea  about  how 
dynamically  cluster  and  cluster  head  are  created  according 

from 

it 

lags 

in  sensor  networks  but 

to a priori probability. Finally cluster head aggregate all the 
data  and  send  it  to  the  sink  node.  Similarly  SEP  [5] 
demonstrates  the  formation  of  cluster  in  heterogeneous 
sensor  networks.  Since  data  correlation  in  wireless  sensor 
networks  shows  Gaussian  distribution  with  zero  mean, 
literature  [6]  shows  the  spatial  correlation  among  data  in 
the  practical 
high 
implementation  of  analyzing 
the  correlated  data  for 
transmitting  the  packets  for  communication.  Literature  [7] 
proposes  a  grid  based  spatial  correlation  clustering  method 
where  the  entire  cluster  is  equipped  in  a  grid  sensor  field.  
However  this  type  of  model  rarely  happens  in  an  original 
scenario  in  wireless  sensor  networks.  Moreover  literature 
[8]  proposes  a  disk-shaped  circular  cluster  where  sensor 
nodes  are  grouped  into  disjoint  sets  each  managed  by  a 
designated  cluster  head  which  lags  the  practical  shape  of  a 
cluster. As most cases the cluster formation are irregular in 
shape in the spatial domain. Hence in this paper we propose 
a  foundation  of  distributed  clustering  algorithm  which  is 
much  more  practical  than  the  previous  work  done  in  the 
spatial  domain.  In  our  model,  we  propose  a  spatially 
correlated  distributed  irregular  non  overlapping  cluster 
formation in the spatial domain. These distributed irregular 
cluster  formation  in  the  spatial  domain  is  much  more 
practical  model  in  original  scenario  than  the  previous 
literature discussed above. 
       Most of the work done till today is based upon the fact 
that  the  sink  node  or  the  base  station  is  responsible  for 
estimating  the  data  accuracy  for  physically  sensed  data  by 
sensor  nodes  [9,  10,  11]  .Therefore  it  is  applicable  for  one 
hop  communication  where  the  raw  data  are  sensed  and 
measured by the sensor nodes and directly transmitted to the 
sink node. Again we propose a model [12] for data accuracy 
where  we  have  considered  two  hop  communications  in 
which  physical  phenomenon  of  sensed  data  is  transmitted 
via intermediate node called cluster head (CH)[18]node. But 
in  this  paper  we  propose  a  distributed  clustering  algorithm 
where  each  cluster  can  perform  data  accuracy  at  their 
respective  CH  node  and  finally  send  the  data  to  the  sink 
node. Each distributed cluster is responsible for sensing and 
measuring  the  physical  phenomenon  of  data  in  the  sensor 
region.  
      The main goal of this paper is to estimate data accuracy 
for  each  distributed  cluster  before  data  aggregation  [19]  at 

 
 
their  respective  CH  node  which  can  reduce  the  data 
redundancy  and  communication  overhead.  However  to  the 
best understanding of the authors, there is no work done so 
far  on  verifying  the  data  accuracy  for  distributed  cluster 
before data aggregation [21, 22] at their respective CH node. 
Since  from  the  literature  survey  we  have  seen  that  most  of 
the  work  done  till  today  is  that  data  from  cluster  of  sensor 
nodes  directly  send  to  CH  node  for  aggregation  without 
verifying  its  accuracy.  Hence  it  is  important  that  the  most 
precise  or  accurate  data  send  by  the  distributed  cluster  can 
aggregate at their respective CH node before transmitting to 
the sink node and not aggregating all the redundant data at 
CH  node.  The  data  send  by  each  distributed  cluster  should 
first  verify  its  accuracy  level  at  their  respective  CH  node 
then only the data get aggregates and finally send to the sink 
node.  Since  CH  node  verifies  the  data  accuracy  for  their 
respective  distributed  cluster,  it  may  reduce  the  power 
consumption and increase the lifetime of the networks. 
    Another important reason for estimating data accuracy for 
each  distributed  cluster  before  data  aggregation  at  their 
respective  CH  node,  if  some  of  the  sensor  nodes  in  the 
distributed cluster get malicious [20]. If some of the sensor 
nodes  become  malicious  in  the  distributed  cluster,  then  it 
can  sense  and  read  inaccurate  data.  These  inaccurate  data 
send by the malicious nodes gets aggregated with the other 
correct data results in inaccurate (incorrect) data aggregation 
at the CH node of their respective cluster and finally send to 
the  sink  node.  This  may  increase  the  power  consumption, 
data  redundancy  and  communication  overhead  in  the 
distributed network. It results very high or low variations of 
the  estimated  data  accuracy  value  compare  to  the  actual 
variations of estimated data accuracy value at the CH node. 
Hence to overcome this problem, it is important to estimate 
the data accuracy at  CH  node for distributed cluster before 
data aggregation and send the accurate data to the sink node. 
In  our  model  we  assume  that  the  sensed  data  are  spatially 
correlated  with  approximately  the  same  variations  in  each 
distributed  cluster  and  the  sensor  nodes  are  appropriate  to 
sense  the  correct  data.  We  verify  estimated  data  accuracy 
with approximately same variations at the CH node for each 
distributed cluster. 
     In  our  model,  each  distributed  cluster  is  responsible  to 
sense  the  physical  phenomenon  of  data  such  as  moisture 
content of soil in the sensor region. Once the data accuracy 
is  processed  by  CH  node  for  each  distributed  cluster,  it 
transmits the estimated accurate data to the sink node. From 
the literature survey, it is clear that only the sensor nodes are 
responsible  to  sense  the  physical  phenomenon  of  data  and 
not  the  sink  node.  But  in  our  model  not  only  sensor  nodes 
are  responsible  to  sense  the  physical  phenomenon  of  data 
but  the  CH  node  can  also  do  the  sensing  phenomenon  in 
each  distributed  cluster.  We 
investigate  how  each 
distributed  cluster  can  sense  the  physical  phenomenon  of 
data  to  estimate  the  data  accuracy  in  the  sensor  field. 
Literature  [9,  13]  has  given  some  approaches  regarding 
jointly sensing nodes which gives an idea about how the raw 

data  is  sensed  by  the  jointly  sensing  nodes  and  how  the 
number  of  jointly  sensing  nodes  affects  the  data  accuracy. 
However  they  address  this  problem  if  only  sensing  nodes 
are  responsible  to  retrieve  physical  phenomenon  of  data 
where they investigate to find a proper number and positions 
of jointly sensing nodes. But in our model, we consider both 
the  sensor  nodes  and  the  CH  node  which  forms  each 
distributed  cluster  in  the  sensor  field  are  sensing  the 
physical phenomenon such as humidity or moisture content 
of  the  soil.    Since  we  verify  data  accuracy  for  each 
distributed  cluster  in  the  sensor  field,  there  exit  an  optimal 
cluster  which  gives  approximately  the  same  data  accuracy 
level achieve by each cluster. 
       Rest of the paper is given as follows. In section II,  we 
construct a data correlation model for sensor nodes in spatial 
domain. These data correlation can give rise to overlapping 
of  clusters  in  the  sensor  region.  Hence  to  overcome  this 
problem, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm with 
non  overlapping  irregular  clusters  in  the  spatial  domain. 
Then we perform data accuracy for each distributed cluster 
at CH node before data aggregation in the sensor region. In 
section  III,  we  verify  simulation  results  for  distributed 
clusters.  We  demonstrate  results  how  each  distributed 
cluster are formed with their respective associate nodes and 
their  data  accuracy.  Then  we  show  the  performance  model 
of a single cluster with respect to data accuracy. Finally we 
conclude our work in section IV. 

II.  SYSTEM MODEL 

    In  this  section,  sensor  nodes  deployment  strategies  are 
done where the sensor nodes form distributed clusters which 
are capable to perform data accuracy in the spatial domain. 
We  propose  an  algorithm  for  distributed  clusters  which 
perform  data  accuracy  at  the  cluster  head  node  where  the 
data are spatially correlated and finally send the data to the 
sink  node.  Let  a  set  of  sensor  nodes  are  deterministically 
deployed  uniformly  over  a  sensor  region  Z.  These  set  of 
sensor  nodes  forms  the  cluster  head  nodes  [18]  for  the 
distributed  clusters  equipped  with  additional  energy 
resource [5]. Since CH node perform the data accuracy for 
the respective distributed clusters, we set the CH node with 
additional energy resource and distributed deterministically 
in  the  sensor  field.  Again  another  set  of  sensor  nodes  are 
randomly deployed over the sensor region Z and are called 
normal nodes [5]. Normal nodes form the distributed cluster 
along  with  their  respective  CH  node  which  can  sense  and 
measure  the  spatially  correlated  data  and  estimate  the  data 
accuracy at the CH node.CH node has more energy resource 
than the normal nodes because CH nodes has to estimate the 
data  accuracy  for  the  cluster.  Thus  CH  nodes  and  normal 
nodes  form  the  total  set  of  sensor  nodes  represented  as  L 
with Z ⊆  R2 where ||L|| can be represented as total number 
of  sensor  nodes.  They  are  capable  for  sensing  and 
measuring the spatially correlated data in the sensor region 
Z. For example, we measure the moisture content of soil at 
different  locations  of  sensor  region  Z.  Generally  there  are 

much  more  variations  in  measurement  of  moisture  content 
at  different  locations  in  the  sensor  field.  Some  places  the 
water  (or  moisture)  content  in  the  soil  are  more  than  other 
different  places  where  the  water  (moisture)  content  is  less. 
Thus there are variations of monitoring the measurement of 
moisture content in the soil at different places in the sensor 
region Z. 
A. 
  Data Correlation for sensor nodes in Spatial Domain  
   We  consider  reference  values  for  higher  concentration  of 
moisture  content  at  different  places  of  sensor  region  Z. 
Suppose  the  reference  values  are  called  tracing  points  [20] 
and  can  be  represented  as  Si  where  i=1,  2,  3…n  are  the 
number of tracing points at different locations in the sensor 
field  with  higher  variations  .The  tracing  points  can  be 
located  at  the  different  places  of  sensor  field  where  the 
moisture  content  is  high.  For  example,  water  (or  moisture) 
content in the soil can be higher at different locations of the 
sensor field. It is considered as reference values for tracing 
points at different locations in sensor the region Z. Although 
the  data  are  spatially  correlated  in  the  sensor  region,  there 
are  variations  in  measurement  for  concentratation  of  data 
(moisture  content)  at  different  places  in  sensor  region  Z. 
The  higher  concentratation  of  data  has  higher  variations 
with  respect  to  lower  variations  of  data  at  different  places. 
In  spatial  domain,  data  correlation  depends  upon  the 
distance between the tracing points to the sensor nodes and 
the  distance  between  jointly  sensing  nodes  [13].  Thus  we 
have two points to note in our work. Firstly, data correlation 
decreases  as  the  distance  between  the  tracing  points  (or 
reference  values)  to  the  sensor  nodes  increases.  Secondly, 
data  correlation  decreases  as  the  distance  between  jointly 
sensing nodes increases. Thus data correlation is more when 
the sensor nodes are close to each other.  
      Since these tracing points has higher concentratation of 
moisture  content  with  higher  variations,  the  sensor  nodes 
can sense the higher variation of tracing points (or reference 
values )at different locations in sensor field . There may be 
higher  or  lower  variations  of  data  (moisture)  measurement 
in  spatial  domain  where  the  data  are  spatially  correlated  in 
the sensor field. Thus if the distance from the tracing point 
to  the  sensor  nodes  increases,  the  variations  of  the  data 
correlation also get decreases.   
     We  represent  a  single  tracing  point  where    Si  for  i=1 
sensed by the sensor nodes Si and Sj where they sense and do 
measurement over a window frame of time T to capture the 
continuous data sample with Si={ si1 ,  si2, si3, ……..sin } and 
Sj={sj1 ,  sj2, sj3, ……..sjn} respectively. The data correlation is 
strong when the tracing point is sensed by the sensor nodes 
Si  and  Sj  located  near  to  each  other.  The  data  correlation 
decreases as sensor node Si and Sj are far apart from tracing 
point. We compute the mean of the sampled data of sensor 
nodes as follows

The equation no. (12), shows the relation between the radius 
of the cluster and the threshold value of spatially correlated 
data.  The  radius  of  the  cluster  depends  upon  the  threshold 
value τ , 1θ and 2θ .If the value of threshold τ increases, the 
radius of the cluster from the CH node located at the centre 
of  the  cluster  get  decreases.  So  we  have  taken  the 
2θ and  the  threshold  valueτ to 
appropriate  value  of

     We consider a square field of area with Z=Z1 x Z2 where 
the  cluster  head  (CH)  node  are  deterministically  deployed 
uniformly  and  the  normal  nodes  are  deployed  randomly  in 
the sensor field Z which form the distributed cluster. Since 
the  number  of  cluster  head  node  deployed  in  the  sensor 
region is known, we get the same number o f clusters as the 
number  of  cluster  head  nodes.  We  are  interested  in 
measuring  the  moisture  content  profile  in  each  cluster 
embedded in the sensor field Z. Thus we assume that every 
cluster has a single tracing point. Every cluster in the sensor 
field  is  responsible  for  sensing  and  measuring  the  physical 
phenomenon of data for the tracing point value. The highly 
correlated  data  among  the  sensor  nodes  and  the  CH  node 
forms the cluster. The CH node located at the centre of each 
cluster performs the estimation of data accuracy and finally 
send the data to the sink node. The number of tracing points 
is equal to the number of cluster head nodes. Hence in our 
model numbers of  sensor (normal) nodes are considered to 
be more than the number of cluster head nodes.

embedded  in  the  sensor  field  which  are  capable  to  sense

The  equation  no.  (13)  shows  the  relation  between  the 
number  of  clusters  and  the  threshold  used  for  data 
correlation. If the threshold increases, the number of clusters 
with  in  the  sensor  field  will  get  increases  and  vice  versa. 
Thus we should choose appropriate threshold for clusters to 
perform  data  correlation  in  the  spatial  domain.  Since  the 
data  are  spatially  correlated  among  the  sensor  nodes,  there 
exist overlapping of clusters in the sensor region Z as shown 
in  Figure  1.  Equations  no  (12)  and  (13)  derives  how  the 
clusters are overlapped among them in the sensor region Z. 
Hence  it  is  important  to  find  a  distributed  algorithm  for 
clusters that can separate out the clusters from each other in 
the sensor region. Overlapping of cluster can sense the same 
correlated  data  among  the  sensor  nodes  and  send  the 
overlapped data to the sink node. It is like utilizing the same 
resource among the sensor nodes .Hence it leads to wastage 
of energy resource among the clusters and increases the data 
redundancy.  Here  we  propose  a  distributed  algorithm  for 
cluster  to  overcome  this  problem  for  spatially  correlated 
data  and  form  non-overlapped  irregular  clusters  in  the 
sensor region Z. 
________________________________________________ 
Algorithm I: Distributed clustering algorithm for spatially 
correlated data in sensor field Z. 
________________________________________________ 
•  Let  U  be  the  set  of  cluster  head  (CH)  nodes 
deterministically  deployed  uniformly  in  sensor 
region Z. 

•  Let V be the set of sensor (normal) nodes randomly 

deployed in sensor region Z. 

•  Let d(a,b) be the Euclidian distance between node 

a and b. 

•  Let  dv  be  the  distance  from  node  v  to  the  nearest 

CH node. 
Initialize dv=  ∞  
Initialize CHv=0 
for v  ∈V 
       for u ∈U  
             if d(v,u)<dv 
                   dv=d(v,u) 
                   CHv=u 
            endif 
      endfor

Thus  the  Algorithm-I  finds  the  distance  between  shortest 
path  from  the  normal  nodes  to  each  CH  nodes  where  the 
data  are  spatially  correlated  among  them  and  find  out  the 
non  overlapping  irregular  distributed  cluster  in  the  sensor 
field Z. Thus the initial input is the overlapping clusters and 
the  final  output  is  the  non  overlapping  irregular  clusters 
formation in the spatial domain.  In the next section we will 
perform  the  data  accuracy  for  each  individual  distributed 
cluster. 

C.  Data Accuracy Model for Distributed Clusters 
  We get distributed non overlapping irregular clusters in the 
sensor  region  Z  as  explained  in  the  previous  section.  Each 
cluster  has  different  set  of  sensor  nodes.  Each  cluster  can 
perform  data  accuracy  at  the  CH  node  before  data 
aggregation.  For  our  convenience,  we  choose  a  single 
cluster  of  M  set  of  sensor  nodes  to  perform  the  data 
accuracy  for  cluster  where  ||M||=m  are  number  of  sensor 
nodes  in  the  cluster.  M  set  of  sensor  nodes  which  form  a 
cluster  can  sense  the  tracing  point  and  check  the  data 
accuracy  at  the  CH  node  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  data 
accuracy for M set of sensor nodes which form a cluster are 
verified before data aggregation process at the CH node for 
each  cluster.  The  data  accuracy  is  performed  to  check  the 
data  received  at  CH  node  for  each  cluster  are  accurate  and 
doesn’t  contain  any  redundant  data.  They  may  reduce  the 
communication  overhead.  For  the  simplicity  of  our  model, 
Single  tracing  point  is  sensed  and  measured  by  only  one 
single cluster. Hence in the sensor region Z, each distributed 
cluster can sense and measure a single tracing point.  
In  our  model,  there  is  a  single  tracing  point  S  which  can 
sense and measure by a respective cluster of M set of sensor 
nodes.  Notation  used  in  data  accuracy  for  distributed 
clusters:

Figure 2: Data accuracy model for distributed cluster 

Here  we  consider  the  mathematical  analysis  for  data 
accuracy for the single cluster in the sensor region Z. Thus 
every  cluster  distributed  in  the  sensor  region  can  verify  its 
data accuracy before data aggregation at the CH node. Once 
this  procedure  is  being  done  by  CH  nodes  for  all  the 
distributed  clusters,  they  send  the  data  to  the  sink  node. 
Each sensor node i in the distributed cluster M can measure 
and observe the physically sensed data Si for tracing point S 
with  observation  noise  Ni.  Hence  the  observation  and 
measurement made by the sensor node i in a given cluster is 
given by

       where i  ∈  M                             (14) 
The  sensor  node  i  can  sense  and  measure  the  observe 
sample  Xi  and  transmits  Xi  to  cluster  head  node  sharing 
wireless  additive  white  Gaussian  noise  (AWGN)  channel 
[9,14]. Hence the observation and measurement received by 
the  CH  node  from  other  sensor  nodes  in  the  cluster  with

D.  Distributed Cluster-based Spatially Correlated Data 

Accuracy Model  

    In this section , a spatial correlation model is framed for 
normalized  data  accuracy  for  each  cluster  in  the  sensor 
region  .Since  distributed  clusters  are  formed  in  the  sensor 
region  ,  every  cluster  can  estimate  its    data  accuracy    to 
sense  and  measure  their  representative  tracing  point.  Each 
tracing  point  is  sensed  and  measured  by  a  single  cluster  of 
sensor  nodes  and  finally  determines  the  data  accuracy  for 
that  cluster  in  the  sensor  region.  Here  we  derive  a 
mathematical model for the distributed cluster where all the 
sensed  data  are  spatially  correlated  among  them.  These 
spatial  correlations  among  data  are  achieved  by  M  set  of 
sensor  nodes.  We  model  spatially  correlated  physical 
phenomenon  of  sensed  data  as  joint  Gaussian  random 
variables (JGRV’s) [5] as follows:

The  equation  no.  (26)  shows  that  the  normalized  data 
AD M  for  each  cluster  depends  upon  m  sensor 
accuracy 
iβ and  CHβ  respectively.  Since  we  get  a 
normalized data accuracy at each CH node for each cluster, 
we  construct  a  spatial  correlation  model  given  by  equation 
no. (26) for each individual distributed cluster in the sensor 
region.  The  spatial  correlation  model  for  each  distributed 
cluster can be explained as follows: 

(cid:1)  Each sensor node i can sense a tracing point  S    
in  each  distributed  cluster  where  i  ∈  M  and  i 
∉ CH node 

(cid:1)  CH node itself can sense the tracing point S in 

each distributed cluster.

      Thus each distributed cluster formed in the sensor region 
has  different  set  of  sensor  nodes.  Hence  each  cluster  can 
perform the normalized data accuracy at the CH node before 
data aggregation. The purpose of verifying the data accuracy 
for  each  cluster  is  to  confirm  that  the  most  accurate  data 
send by m set of sensor nodes can aggregate at the CH node 
rather  than  aggregating  all  the  redundant  data  at  the  CH 
node.  To  visualize  the  correlation  model  for  distributed 
cluster,  we  take  an  example  where  m=4  sensor  nodes  and 
out of m sensor nodes one node is chosen as a CH node as 
shown  in  Figure  3.  Once  we  estimate  the  data  accuracy  at 
the  CH  node for each distributed cluster, the  most accurate 
data get aggregated and finally send to the sink node.  

III.  SIMULATION RESULTS  

In  the  first  simulation  setup  ,  twenty  five  CH  nodes  are 
deterministically  deployed  uniformly  and  hundred  sensor 
(normal) nodes are deployed  randomly  in a  wireless sensor 
field of 120 m X 120 m based sensor topology as shown in 
Figure  1  .  Each  CH  node  performs  the  data  accuracy  for 
their  respective  cluster.  Hence  each  cluster  can  sense  and 
measure  a  single  tracing  point  randomly  located  in  each 
cluster  region.  Once  each  cluster  can  sense  and  measure

previously,  each  CH  node  can  form  the  cluster  with  their 
the  sensor  nodes  are 
associated  sensor  nodes.  Once 
associated with each CH node, they form distributed clusters 
in the sensor region Z. Thus twenty five CH nodes can form 
twenty  five  individual  non-overlapping  distributed  clusters. 
Each  distributed  cluster  can  perform  the  data  accuracy  at 
their  respective  CH  node  as  shown  in  Table-1.  Similarly  in 
the  second  simulation  set  up  as  shown  in  Table-2,  we

Figure 4: Deployed sensor nodes in circular cluster topology 

In  the  third  simulation  set  up,  we  take  a  single  circular 
cluster of m=4 sensor nodes which can sense and measure a 
tracing point. We put m sensor nodes in a deployed circular 
cluster  and  a  tracing  point  S  located  at  the  centre  of  the 
deployed  circular  cluster.  i.e  dS,i  (where  i=1,2,3)and  dS,CH 
are  equidistance  as  shown  in  the  Figure  4.  Here  we  have 
fixed  the  number  of  m  sensor  nodes  and  vary  the  distance

          Figure 5: Data accuracy versus radius of the circular cluster  

    In  the  fourth  simulation  setup,  the  distance  from  the 
tracing  point  S  to  m  sensor  nodes  is  fixed  in  the  deployed 
circular cluster of radius =5 metre. We increase the number 
of sensor nodes with a fixed distance from the tracing point 
S  i.e  we  increase  m  sensor  nodes  with  fixed  deployed 
circular cluster of radius 5 metre.  At first, we put m=2 (one 
CH  node  and  one  sensor  node)  which  shows  that  the  data 
accuracy is very poor  with its value  in between 0.6 to 0.75 
1θ ={50,100,200,400}.The  reason    is  that  there  is  only 
for 
one  sensor  node  which  shows  that  the  third  condition    of  
spatial  correlation  model  given  in  section  II(D)  doesn’t

satisfies the 
cluster  head  and  two  sensor  nodes),  there  is  a  drastic 
( )AD M  since  all  the  conditions  for  spatial 
improvement  of 
correlation model are satisfied. The Figure-6 also shows that 
AD M  for the 
five to eight nodes are sufficient to perform the 
cluster, if the distance from tracing point to m sensor nodes 
with deployed circular cluster of radius is 5 metre.  
For  the  simplicity  of  our  model,  we  perform  the  fifth 
simulation set up where we have simulated a wireless sensor 
field  (900  metre2)  of  5m  X  5m  grid  based  single  cluster 
topology  with  a  fixed  tracing  point  (S)  at  the  centre  and  a 
CH  node  on  the  corner  edge  with  47  sensor  nodes 
distributed  uniformly  in  the  grid  based  cluster  topology  as 
shown  in  Figure  7.Our  assumptions  is  that  cluster  of  m 
sensor  nodes  are  in  the  sensing  range  of  the  tracing  point 
(S).  Initially  we  put  m=4(one  cluster  head  node  and  three 
sensor  nodes  located  at  the  four  extreme  corner  of  sensor

   In the sixth simulation setup, we take a single cluster of m 
sensor nodes randomly deployed in a region (30 X 30 = 900 
metre2) that  sense and  measure a tracing point.  We fix the 
tracing  point  at  x,y  (15,15)  coordinate  and  CH  node  at  x,y 
(0,0)  coordinate  with  99    sensor  nodes  randomly  deployed 
in  the  region.  For  each  run  we  verify

randomly  deployed  cluster  of  m  sensor  nodes.  Finally  we

we  propose  a  distributed  algorithm  with  non  overlapping 
irregular cluster for the spatially correlated data in the sensor 
( )AD M  before 
region.  Each  distributed  cluster  can  perform 
data  aggregation  at  their  respective  CH  node.  Hence  it  is 
important  to  sense  and  measure  the  most  appropriate 
(accurate)  data  send  by  each  distributed  cluster  at  the  CH 
node  rather  than  aggregating  all  the  redundant  data  at  their 
respective CH node. Thus it can reduce the data redundancy. 
Since  the  data  accuracy  is  performed  by  each  distributed 
cluster,  we  verified  from  the  simulation  results  that  there 
exists  a  minimal  set  of  sensor  nodes  with  optimal  cluster 
( )AD M  as 
which is sufficient to give approximately the same  
achieved  by  the  each  distributed  cluster.  Therefore  the  time 
complexity  done  at  each  CH  node  of  respective  distributed 
cluster  for  aggregating  the  most  accurate  data  send  by  their 
respective  optimal  cluster  will  be  less.  Thus  we  find  an 
optimal  cluster  from  each  distributed  cluster  which  can 
reduce the data redundancy and communication overhead. 

    In the fifth simulation setup, a grid based single cluster is 
formed  where  we  deployed  m=48  sensor  nodes  uniformly. 
We  examine  that  15  to  20  nodes  are  sufficient  to  perform 
1θ =400  in  900  metre2  cluster  region. 
( )AD M =0.944  for 
Similarly  in  sixth  simulation  setup  a  cluster  with  m=100 
sensor  nodes  are  randomly  deployed  in  900  metre2  region 
and  we  get  10  to  15  sensor  nodes  are  sufficient  to  perform 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1θ =400.  Therefore  it  is  unnecessary  to 
( )AD M =0.944  for 
choose so many sensor nodes in 900 metre2 region as 
( )AD M  
remains approximately same as it achieve the saturation level 
still  we  increase  m  sensor  nodes  in  the  cluster.  Hence  we 
have  P  minimal  set  of  sensor  nodes  with  optimal  cluster 
which is sufficient to give approximately the same 
( )AD M  by 
M set of sensor nodes in each distributed cluster as shown by

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 

In  this  paper  we  investigate  that  the  data  are  spatially 
correlated  among  sensor  nodes  and  form  clusters  in  the 
sensor  region.  Since  the  data  are  highly  correlated  in  the 
spatial  domain,  the  sensor  nodes  form  regular  overlapping 
clusters  among  them  in  the  sensor  region.  Overlapping  of 
cluster  can  sense  and  measure  the  same  correlated  data 
among  the  clusters.  Thus  to  overcome  this  situation,  we 
constructed  a  distributed  clustering  algorithm  with  data 
accuracy  model 
.We  perform  data  accuracy  for  each 
distributed cluster. We find that the most accurate data send 
by  the  distributed  cluster  can  aggregate  at  the  CH  node 
rather  than  aggregating  all  the  redundant  data  at  their 
respective CH node. We demonstrate by simulation that the 
data  accuracy  for  a  single  cluster  depend  on  number  of 
sensor  nodes  and  their  exist  an  optimal  cluster  which  is 
adequate to sense and  measure the tracing point to perform 
approximately  the  same  data  accuracy  level  achieve  by 
single  cluster.  Finally  we  conclude  that  the  data  accuracy 
performed  for  each  distributed  cluster  can  reduce  the  data 
redundancy and communication overhead.
