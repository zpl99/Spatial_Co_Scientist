Abstract

This study employs percolation theory to investigate the hierarchical organisation of

Australian urban centres through the connectivity of their road networks. The analysis

demonstrates how discrete urban clusters have developed into integrated regional entities,

delineating the pivotal distance thresholds that regulate these urban transitions. The study

reveals the interconnections between disparate urban clusters, shaped by their functional

differentiation and historical development. Furthermore, the study identifies a dichotomy of

urban agglomeration forces and a persistent spatial disconnection between Australia’s wider

urban landscape. This highlights the interplay between urban densification and peripheral

growth. It suggests the need for new thinking on potential integrated governance structures

that bridge urban development with broader social and economic policies across regional

and national scales. Additionally, the study emphasises the growing importance of national

coordination in Australian urban development planning to ensure regional consistency, equity,

and productivity.

Introduction

Cities are complex systems characterised by the dynamic process of merging and partitioning

of regions and communities [6]. They are continuously shaped by geographical, political, and

historical factors, creating diverse urban environments. The expansion of cities is supported by

infrastructure networks, which reflect the spatial organisation and functional differentiation that
characterise urban areas [9, 10, 11]. The road network plays a pivotal role in this differentiation,

serving as a vital reflection of urban functions and a primary driver of city expansion.

Its

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
structures are directly shaped by historical patterns and usage, offering valuable insights into

future growth trajectories [2, 4].

Indeed, [9] highlighted a direct correlation between network expansion and growth trajectories

that follow Gibrat’s Law [12], a pattern previously confirmed by [21] in their comparison of city

conformations to established growth frameworks (e.g., Zipf’s Law). Similarly, [11] demonstrated

that key topological features, such as network growth and average nodal connectivity, can be

used to provide precise delineations of urban areas. This finding is supported by [10] in their

models of urban partitioning.

However, while these studies provide useful insights into quantifying growth patterns, they

leave the structured relationships and hierarchical order between urban clusters less explored,
which represents a significant area for future research.

The application of percolation theory provides a valuable means of investigating the connec-

tivity and hierarchical organisation of cities, offering a link between the insights gained in the

aforementioned research [1, 28]. Originally a concept in physics, it has found useful applications

in urban studies. By incrementally connecting network elements, it is possible to identify the

hierarchical relationships that exist within urban systems. This ultimately enables the charac-

terisation and regionalisation of urban centres at different scales. The process thus organises

urban network connections, including urban centres, cities, and towns, into a structured hierarchy

based on the size of each cluster within the network. In this framework, each segment or cluster

represents an urban cluster and the corresponding regional systems, collectively reflecting the

natural organisation of the urban network.

The potential of this approach was demonstrated by [4], who used percolation to map

the hierarchical organisation of towns and cities in Britain. They identified critical network

connection points that reflected well-known existing hierarchies in the United Kingdom, revealing

patterns and clusters that have been influenced by both natural and historical socioeconomic

divisions. It is of particular significance that their work illuminated the manner in which these

divisions (or percolation transitions), which may be defined as the points at which disparate

network segments converge to form discernible centres, can be attributed to the expansion of the

country’s urban centres and their associated functions. These transitions were deemed crucial for

understanding urban hierarchies and regional divisions, further informing development planning

and socioeconomic policy.

Building upon this, [7] applied percolation analysis, at a more regional scale, to population and

transport networks across Western Europe. Their work shed light on the intricate interconnectivity

of European urban regions, delineating expansive mega-urban areas and identifying a multitude

of diverse activity hubs as their fundamental constituents. Significantly, the study also uncovered
distinct transition states for different interacting network types, relating to the different economic

and population hubs across Europe. The research proposed a novel framework for unravelling the

interactive relationships between urban function, population distribution, and movement within

urban systems that were previously considered distinct.

1.1 The evolution of Australian urban centres

Australia’s geography and diverse urban centres offer a unique case study for applying percolation

to better understand the relationships and functional connections between its numerous urban

centres. Historical records indicate that Australia’s urban development has been shaped by

three key factors: agriculture, mining, and the growth of transportation infrastructure [18]. In

particular, the rapid expansion of railway networks during the Industrial Revolution has had a

significant impact on the country’s urban landscape. By 1910, most of Australia’s major urban

centres were already established, primarily located along the coast or near rail networks [17].

However, the pattern of urban growth in Australia has since shifted significantly. In recent

times, there has been a decline in the relative population of regional towns and cities, while the

population in capital cities has grown and become denser, with car travel becoming prevalent in

these urban areas [22, 23, 24].

Furthermore, there have been notable shifts in the functional roles of urban centres throughout

the country[18]. In particular, research by [18] on new urban hierarchies provides an economic

and functional classification of Australia’s contemporary urban centres (ref. Table 1). This

analysis identifies distinct profiles among these urban areas. The presented framework allows for
the identification of the distinctive characteristics and roles of diverse urban regions. Additionally,

the analysis emphasises the evolving roles and diversification of towns, underscoring the changing

relationship among Australia’s urban centres and their centralising effect in response to modern

economic changes.

3

These changing spatial patterns, driven by economic and infrastructural shifts, have been

demonstrated to have tangible effects on development and population dispersion. As illustrated by

[8], the influence of these urban configurations on the spatial distribution of population patterns

across Australian capital cities, aligning with [7]’s findings on the relationship between urban

infrastructure and social dynamics. [5] quantified these functional relationships across Australian

suburbs using centrality measures, thereby demonstrating that the polycentricity of functional

centres and population cores is primarily driven by transit-led infrastructure development. While

these studies contribute to our understanding of urban growth patterns and centralities, there is

still a need for a comprehensive description of the relationships and hierarchical order between

Australia’s distinct urban clusters.

This study is an exploratory examination of Australia’s urban hierarchical structures, as

revealed by its road network. Our research aims to extend the knowledge gained from previous

studies by exploring the connectivity of the road network in uncovering the network partitioning of

different urban centres throughout the country. Specifically, we focus on revealed urban clusters,

which are defined through their nodal connectivity. We explore these structures through the

lens of percolation theory, seeking to move beyond traditional statistical methods typically used

in Australia. Our approach aims to uncover more nuanced relationships between the country’s

many different urban centres and highlight their existing hierarchical structures. The findings of

this research are expected to offer new insights into the country’s urban landscapes, which may

have utility in substantiating urban growth trends and developing sustainable urban planning

policies in future.

2 Methodology

2.1 Data

The analysis employed the road network of Australia, sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM

is an open-source project that provides urban datasets, created through crowdsourcing, to the

general public. Figure 1 visualises the spatial distribution and intersection density of the dataset,

which has been rasterised at 150-metre grids. In the processing stage, the data was simplified to
reduce the number of vertices and to remove nodes that do not convey any topological meaning.

This is in accordance with the specifications set by [6]. The initial dataset, comprising over 9

million points, was reduced to approximately 1.9 million intersection points, each representing

an individual node within the network graph. Moreover, to guarantee network connectivity, an

iterative nodal intersection function was devised and implemented on the processed dataset to

guarantee network connectivity. This ensured that the degree of network connectivity equalled

1, indicating that all nodes in the network are connected to each another. Each node was

subsequently indexed, and its adjacency to other connected nodes was defined through edge

weightings corresponding to network distances within a distance matrix. This constructed network

served as the basis for the subsequent percolation analysis.

2.2 Network Percolation

Percolation theory examines the additive linking of network intersections as distance thresholds

increase, with each threshold marking a transition point where previously unconnected segments

4

Figure 1: Intersection density of the Australia road network binned in 150m grids

merge into larger, connected clusters [1, 28]. At any given threshold, the largest connected units,
constrained by the distance threshold d0, are aggregated and considered as single urban clusters.
These clusters represent the maximal network-continuous links for that threshold [6, 25, 26].

In this study, we conducted a percolation analysis on interconnected intersection points using

a distance-based clustering algorithm, following the methods described by [4]. Clusters are

initiated at random nodes and subsequently expanded through the recursive addition of new
links. The formation of a cluster is contingent upon the proximity of two nodes—denoted by
vk and vi—to one another, with the requisite threshold being d0. This is represented by the
condition d(vk, vi) < r0. In this analysis, the percolation radius, denoted by r0, was set within a
range of 100 metres to 30,000 metres, with distance increments of 20 metres. Given the expansive

extent of the study area, the formation of a single cluster was not reached, even at the maximum

threshold of 30,000 metres. Consequently, several isolated clusters remained at the maximal

threshold set for the analysis.

5

3 Results

We track the evolution of the largest cluster across varying distance thresholds, revealing a

series of percolation transitions that lead to the formation of distinct urban clusters nationwide.

The progression of the largest cluster, shown in Figure 2, demonstrates how regions merge at
different percolation radii r0, indicated by the number of nodes. This analysis quantifies the
transformation of urban clusters, highlighting the correlation between the size of the largest

cluster and its expansion throughout the system.

Figure 2: Transition state of the largest cluster’s size across all percolation distance thresholds

The initial transition phase, occurring at distance of 260m, unveils most capital cities (ref. to

Figure 3). The largest clusters are identified for Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide (ref. Figure 3A

- Figure 3D). [4] refers to this threshold as the ’system of cities’, which aligns with [18]’s archetype

of ’diversified urban centres’. These centres are characterised by their denser populations, dense

urban structures, and varied economies. In the state of Victoria, it is evident that distinct,

sizeable clusters are present on the outskirts of Melbourne, encompassing areas such as Werribee,

Cranbourne, and Geelong. The distinction between the city centre and these suburbs, despite

their relative proximity, is highlighted by this separation. These suburbs may be regarded as

significant cores in their own right. A notable separation between the northern and southern

parts of Perth is also observed (ref. Figure 3A), with the city topographically divided by Swan

River. It is interesting to note that this separation is not as pronounced in Sydney, which has a

more interconnected urban structure despite being separated by Sydney Harbour. In Queensland,

the analysis reveals that Brisbane and the Gold Coast are the largest urban centres in the state

(ref. Figure 3E). It is worth noting that the core of Brisbane, particularly in comparison to other

capital city clusters at this distance threshold, appears to be considerably smaller than expected,

especially when considering the extent of the statistical boundary of Greater Brisbane. Similarly,

Adelaide presents a clearly defined boundary to its city extent, which is topologically constrained

by the expanse of national parks to its south.

At a distance threshold of 360m, network percolation shows the expansion of most capital

city clusters, accompanied by the emergence of several smaller secondary cities. In Victoria,

Melbourne’s city centre undergoes significant expansion, effectively integrating most of the suburbs

to the south-east and north of Melbourne’s city centre. In Victoria, Melbourne’s city centre

undergoes significant expansion, effectively integrating most of the suburbs to the south-east and

north of Melbourne’s city centre. In addition, centres such as Wyndham Vale and Truganina

merge to form the largest cluster in Victoria. At this distance, the secondary cities Ballarat

and Geelong emerge as the other major agglomerations in Victoria. This highlights their clear

separation from Melbourne city. It is worth noting that these clusters were historically part of

the Victorian Gold Cities, which were established as the state’s major manufacturing centres in

part due to their connection to the railway [18]. In New South Wales, however, the main city

of Sydney has not expanded significantly. Instead, the secondary city of Newcastle emerges as
the second most prominent cluster. In this transitional phase, Canberra also begins to form a

large, distinct cluster, indicating its urban importance in the region’s network configuration. In

Western Australia, North and South Perth merge. No other significant clusters are identified in

Queensland and South Australia at this distance threshold, suggesting a relative separation of

other peripheral urban centres within the region.

7

Figure 4: Cluster differences along Australia’s eastern coast at d = 1, 480m.

At the 1,480m threshold, the analysis reveals the country’s many regional systems through

the agglomeration of the main coastal cities.

In Victoria, a notable urban cluster emerges,

extending from Bendigo to Castlemaine and merging with the Melbourne metropolitan area.

Ballarat, however, remains a separate cluster, distinct from the Melbourne metropolitan area. In

Queensland, Townsville emerges as a new significant cluster; in the Northern Territory, Darwin

city becomes visible as a distinct cluster at this threshold, marking its first appearance in

the transition phases. Both Townsville and Darwin, originally seaports, have diversified their
economies to include defence facilities and tourism, and both now stand as distinct clusters of

comparable size to other Australian cities. An extensive cluster extending from Noosa Head to

Ballina in the city of Brisbane is also observed as the second largest cluster in the system. In New

South Wales, despite their geographical proximity, there remains a persistent disconnect between

the Sydney-Shoalhaven cluster and the Gosford-Newcastle cluster. It is notable that these two

clusters in NSW form part of the state’s Greater City Commissions ”six cities” regional plan [20].

These areas are classified by [17] as ’coastal commuter’ areas, located in transition zones between

regional and urban areas. However, their separation suggests complex patterns of urban growth

that may be influenced by physical barriers, differences in economic activity or differences in

urban planning and development policies. In Western Australia and South Australia, the main

clusters in Perth and Adelaide continue to grow.

At the 2,340m distance threshold, the analysis identifies the emergence of a distinct group of

satellite towns, each with a population size between 500 and 1,500 people — a finding similar

to that shown by [17]. This threshold highlights the geographic distribution and connectivity

of smaller communities in relation to larger urban centres. In Victoria, the Melbourne cluster

begins to extend beyond state boundaries, while smaller, distinct clusters around Marong, Mount

Gambier, Hamilton and Portland are observed as separate entities, reflecting the diverse urban

landscape within the state. Along the east coast, spanning New South Wales and Queensland,

a significant urban cluster extends from Maryborough to Shoalhaven, reflecting the dense

urbanisation along Australia’s east coast, with Beerburrum and Tumbulgum emerging as distinct

clusters from this amalgamation. In contrast, Western Australia and South Australia do not show

8

significant expansion of primary capital clusters. This finding is indicative of Perth’s central role

within its state and Adelaide’s relative isolation from other major urban centres. No significant

clusters are found in the Northern Territory at this threshold.

Figure 5: Cluster formation between d = 3, 160m and d = 3, 700m, highlighting the separation of
Canberra from NSW and Victoria.

Between the distance thresholds of 3,160m and 3,700m (see figure 5), a notable transition

occurs along the south-east coast of Australia. During this phase, the main clusters in New

South Wales and Victoria merge to form an extensive northeastern crescent covering the area
from Brisbane to Melbourne. More than 80 per cent of Australians live in this cluster. This

clustering represents a significant shift in the spatial dynamics of these regions. In particular,

wve see the merging of cities within the country’s notable ”wheat-sheep belt” into its major

urban clusters, potentially delineating the country’s modern economic geography. It should

be noted, however, that despite the large distance thresholds, distinct clusters continue to

exist independently. In particular, Canberra remains a distinct cluster, further emphasising

its separate geographic and infrastructural identity. Despite its proximity to both Sydney and

Melbourne, Canberra remains distinctly separate from this integrated urban system. Canberra’s

distinct geographic and infrastructural characteristics prevent it from being integrated into the

Sydney-Melbourne supercluster, emphasising its independent spatial identity. Similarly, Adelaide

maintains its separation from the Melbourne and Sydney superclusters. Both of these separations

are particularly striking given their close physical distance from their nearest metropolitan areas.

However, their separation reflects unique factors in their regional positioning.

9

Figure 6: Cluster changes at distances 8,720m (A), 14,680m (B), 17,700m (C), and 24,580m (D).

At this threshold, the emergence of smaller, more isolated cities within the system becomes

apparent. For example, smaller cities such as Townsville and Cairns in Queensland remain

separate, further illustrating the diverse spatial dynamics of Australia’s urban landscape. Centres

such as Alice Springs, Kununurra, Karratha, Broome and Port Augusta also stand out as distinct

clusters. These smaller cities, identified by Freestone as historic agricultural and mining service

towns and transport hubs, reflect the post-industrial development of these regions. They continue

to play a vital role in supporting regional economies and connecting remote areas, despite their

isolation from the larger urban clusters along the south-east coast.

The final stages of network transitions in our study are observed between distances of 8,720m

and 24,580m. At a distance of 8,720m, the analysis reveals a clear separation between eastern

and western Australia, illustrating the notable east-west divide in the country. Smaller clusters in

the Northern Territory and North Queensland are observed, relating to a separate amalgamation

that encompasses the region from Cairns to Mackay (ref. Figure 6A). At a distance of 14,680m

(ref. Figure 6B), these clusters coalesce to form the largest cluster in eastern Australia, still

remaining distinct from those in Western Australia and Northern Australia. In this phase, towns

10

in central Australia, including Alice Springs, begin to emerge. As the transition progresses past

the 17,700m threshold, most of Australia’s urban centres amalgamate into a single extensive

cluster, with remaining separation of smaller towns across the country, such as Karratha, Broome,

and Mount Isa (ref. Figure 6C). It is interesting to note these final transition phases also uncover

the remote Aboriginal Land Trust areas, in addition to historic mining centres.

highlighting the progression from localised groupings to broader regional clusters.

In the final transition phase, the majority of Australia converges into largely a single cluster.

A simplified visualisation of the largest cluster, illustrating how the final percolation transition

relates to broader regional groupings and constituent cities, is shown in Figure 7. No further

significant transition phases were identified as the percolation analysis concluded at a distance of
30,000m. A reduced visualisation of the largest cluster is shown in Figure 7.

4 Discussions

Australia’s population is expected to increase by around 11.3 million by 2056, with 75 per

cent of this growth concentrated in the major cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.

This demographic evolution is likely to reinforce the current urban development trajectory,

with people settling particularly along the country’s east coast. Cities and towns in this area

appear to be evolving into a complex network of suburban and urban centres, potentially leading

11

to the formation of a crescent-shaped mega-metro regional hybrid along the east coast, from

Melbourne-Geelong to Sydney-Newcastle and south-east Queensland. This transformation is

evident across a range of thresholds, with the shift from distinct clusters to sprawling regional

entities occurring at distances beyond 1,480 metres.

These findings challenge traditional planning paradigms that promote consolidation and

compact urban development within these states. Their contiguity, from Brisbane to Melbourne,

highlights a significant opportunity for planning and managing metropolitan and regional complex-

ities as critical aspects of the country’s future spatial planning. Peripheral growth is becoming

as important as urban densification, requiring a governance structure that addresses urban

development in concert with broader social and economic policies across the states. This is
essential to maintain consistency in urban planning across regions, particularly in the face of

significant population growth concentrated mainly in Australia’s four largest cities.

Several studies have also recognised this increasing interconnectedness of Australia’s eastern

crescent and the potential limitations of the current planning system in accommodating these

emerging spatial patterns.

In particular, [16] and [13] both present empirical evidence and

similar conclusions regarding the management of the ”200-km city” encompassing Brisbane, the

Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast — the same urban cluster identified in this paper with

a d = 1, 480m and d = 2, 340m. Building on this, [13] argues for a collaborative governance

framework that transcends local, regional and national boundaries. This framework would include

comprehensive spatial planning and policy integration to address the multiple challenges posed by

extensive urbanisation, such as climate change, infrastructure demands, socio-spatial equity and

environmental integrity. Such a framework remains critical if Australian planning is to effectively

adapt to the evolving urban landscape and manage the complexities of mega-metropolitan regions.

Another key finding of the paper’s analysis is the notable functional differentiation between

cities that emerges within Australia’s urban hierarchy, consistent with [18]’s classification of cities

and the empirical findings of [17]. The analysis highlights the significant legacy of agricultural and

mining towns in Australia’s development. Across the network transition states, distinct towns

with a shared history of mining and agricultural services continue to emerge, highlighting the

historical importance of these activities in Australia’s urban spatial distribution and development.

For example, the Goldfields region of Western Australia, several hundred kilometres east of Perth,

illustrates the impact of mining on the establishment and peripheral distribution of towns in the

state’s regional landscape. Similarly, towns such as Karratha, Broome and Mount Isa are notable

for their historic role as industrial and mining centres, contributing significantly to their regional

economies despite their strong geographical isolation.

However, significant changes in urban centres over the past 20 years have challenged the
legacy of agricultural and mining towns in the overall development of the country. While distinct

cities with a shared history of mining and agricultural services continue to emerge, highlighting

their historical importance in Australia’s urban spatial distribution and development, it is worth

considering whether [18]’s original labels of the functional differentiation of the country’s cities and

towns still apply. There may be opportunities to update the characterisation of the many cities

and towns that exist in contemporary Austarlia by better understanding the interactions between

employment and population networks within these cities and towns. Current prevailing work

preferences, particularly for fly-in-fly-out long-distance commuters, have created a dependence of

regional centres and townships on transient populations and workforces, raising questions about

12

the sustainability and development of areas reliant on an ever-changing workforce and fluctuating

resource economies [27, 29].

Australia’s urban challenges are characterised by the contrasting approaches of urban contain-

ment and extensive regional growth policies. This duality stems from historical continuities and

discontinuities, particularly in land use and infrastructure development. While past infrastructure

and governance, such as railways and company-owned mining townships, have shaped urban

development, they may also limit the flexibility of urban systems to adapt to new economic

realities and technological advances. A critical examination of how historical constraints hinder or

shape future urban growth is essential to inform more adaptive, forward-looking urban planning

strategies. Questions arise as to whether the future planning of autonomous regional cities should
include input from larger neighbouring cities. Coordination at the sub-national and regional

levels is essential to ensure consistent urban development across states. This approach would

integrate regional cities with larger urban centres and promote coherent, sustainable development

strategies that address both regional needs and broader metropolitan growth.

We also need to consider their current and future significance and the extent to which they

require revitalisation and continued investment. Australia’s smaller regional centres and cities

are at risk of decline, as highlighted by [19], due to the centralising effect of urban centres

in Australia’s contemporary growth pattern, with larger regional cities providing access to

communities and amenities. Their geographical isolation and reliance on specific industries make

them vulnerable to economic fluctuations and shifts in industry demand. They serve as critical

transition zones, linking regional and urban centres. However, they remain vulnerable to potential

declines in the mining and agricultural sectors.Current strategies should prioritise diversified

economic approaches and sustainable urban planning to ensure their long-term viability and

integration into the wider urban system.Ultimately, the future relevance and survival of these

cities are pressing concerns that require further research and strategic planning. Ultimately, the

future relevance and survival of these cities remain key concerns that require further research

and strategic planning.

Finally, the current trajectory suggests that there are emerging centres that extend across

state boundaries, particularly in northern New South Wales, where urban and regional growth

are increasingly merging. This requires multi-scalar governance, involving synchronised efforts

across all levels of government - local, state and national - as well as contributions from the

private and community sectors. Such governance is critical as Australian cities move away from

isolated centres and require adaptive infrastructure and planning to strengthen their resilience

through sustainable development strategies. These efforts need to be coordinated across all levels

of government and supported by the private and community sectors.

4.1 Limitations and future work

This study has provided insights into the hierarchical structure of Australian urban centres

using percolation analysis. However, it is important to acknowledge that reliance on road

network connectivity as the primary data source may not fully capture the complexities of urban

development and interactions between regions. Urban systems involve a multitude of factors

beyond physical connectivity, including social, economic, and environmental interactions, which

may not be adequately represented in this analysis. As such, this paper serves as a foundational

starting point, but future research should incorporate additional connectivity measures to capture

13

the multifaceted nature of urban systems. Integrating other forms of connectivity, such as social

networks, economic ties, and various transportation modes beyond road networks, could provide

a more comprehensive understanding of urban dynamics.

Further work should also focus on smaller geography analysis to capture localised patterns

and nuances in urban development that may be obscured in larger-scale analyses. Future research

could address these limitations by breaking down the percolation analysis within individual

states to better understand the spatial distribution of towns and the functional differentiation

of these towns. This approach would include new classification of urban centres to allow for a

more detailed examination of urban structures and take account of their unique geographical and

socio-economic development histories. Incorporating this into the percolation clusters would be
crucial in capturing the complexity of Australia’s urban systems more comprehensively.

5 Conclusions

This study utilised percolation theory to explore the hierarchical structures of Australian urban

centres, utilising road network connectivity as a proxy. The analysis revealed distinct clusters of

urban centres that evolve as connectivity thresholds increase. This methodological approach goes

beyond traditional statistical frameworks used in urban studies and provides novel insights into

the complex linkages that underpin Australia’s diverse urban landscape.

A notable finding was the interplay between connectivity and separation within Australia’s

urban system, reflecting the country’s unique geography and historical patterns of development.

Initially, capital cities and major towns formed distinct clusters, but as connectivity thresholds

increased, a pronounced east-west spatial divide emerged, along with the persistent disconnection

of historically significant agricultural and mining centres. The study also highlighted the crucial

role of regional centres that emerge at intermediate thresholds, acting as vital hubs linking larger

urban agglomerations with smaller, isolated communities and facilitating access to goods, services

and infrastructure.

The research also observed the transformation of distinct urban clusters across Australia

into extensive regional entities, particularly along the densely populated east coast. This

evolution challenges traditional planning paradigms focused on consolidation and compact urban

development. It highlights the potential emergence of mega-metro regional hybrids, particularly

along the eastern crescent spanning cities such as Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, where

interconnected suburban and urban networks could merge into large regional entities. The
pattern of peripheral growth, together with continued urban densification, underlines the need

for governance structures that integrate urban development with broader regional and national

social and economic policies. Such integrated approaches are essential to ensure coherence and

consistency across scales and regions.

The findings underline the growing importance of national coordination in urban development

planning. As urban areas potentially extend beyond national borders, a coordinated approach

at national level is essential to ensure consistency across regions. Effectively managing the

complexities of a potential mega-metropolitan region requires collaborative efforts across local,

regional and national boundaries. This is particularly relevant in Australia, where urban growth

patterns may not align with existing state boundaries, highlighting the need for collaborative

efforts across local, regional and national boundaries.
