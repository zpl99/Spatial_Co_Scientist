Bayesian spatial clustering of extremal behaviour for
hydrological variables

Christian Rohrbeck and Jonathan A. Tawn

Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University

Abstract

To address the need for eﬃcient inference for a range of hydrological extreme value

problems, spatial pooling of information is the standard approach for marginal tail

estimation. We propose the ﬁrst extreme value spatial clustering methods which

account for both the similarity of the marginal tails and the spatial dependence

structure of the data to determine the appropriate level of pooling. Spatial depen-

dence is incorporated in two ways: to determine the cluster selection and to account

for dependence of the data over sites within a cluster when making the marginal

inference. We introduce a statistical model for the pairwise extremal dependence

which incorporates distance between sites, and accommodates our belief that sites

within the same cluster tend to exhibit a higher degree of dependence than sites

in diﬀerent clusters. We use a Bayesian framework which learns about both the

number of clusters and their spatial structure, and that enables the inference of

site-speciﬁc marginal distributions of extremes to incorporate uncertainty in the

clustering allocation. The approach is illustrated using simulations, the analysis of

daily precipitation levels in Norway and daily river ﬂow levels in the UK.

1 Introduction

Statistical models for estimating the frequency and size of ﬂood and severe rainfall events

are required by decision makers to construct eﬀective protection measures and by risk

analysts to set insurance premiums. Since such extreme events occur rarely at a site

of interest, model-based estimates for the behaviour of extremes at a site are usually

derived using a small number of observations, inducing high uncertainty. With a view to

obtaining more reliable estimates, pooling of information from other sites can be used; this

is the basis of regional methods which are widely used for environmental, meteorological

or hydrological hazards (Hosking and Wallis, 1993; Casson and Coles, 1999; Sang and

Gelfand, 2009; Asadi et al., 2018). Natural questions that arise in this context are what

criteria should be used to group sites, and how should the uncertainty in the clustering

allocation, given this selected criterion, be reﬂected in the uncertainty in the estimated

site-speciﬁc marginal distributions, and what do the estimated clusters look like?

We propose a novel approach for spatial clustering of extremes and the subsequent

inference which coherently addresses these questions. Our methodology is motivated

by two applications: modelling weather-related insurance claims and ﬂood risk analysis

described in Section 2. In both applications, we are interested in the extremal behaviour of

a hydrological variable across multiple spatial locations. Each of these problems requires

the marginal analysis of extreme values at diﬀerent locations, whilst accounting for spatial

structure both in the marginal distributions and in the dependence of the data from across

sites.

Our approach for modelling both marginal and dependence structures is to use statis-

tical models that have been asymptotically justiﬁed by extreme value theory (Coles, 2001;

Beirlant et al., 2004). When considering the extremes of a univariate random variable

X, we adopt the peaks-over threshold approach. Exceedances by X of a high threshold

u are then modelled using the generalized Pareto distribution GPD(ψ, ν) with

P(X ≤ x + u | X > u) = 1 −

for x > 0,

where y+ = max(y, 0), and ψ > 0 and ν ∈ R are scale and shape parameters. The value of

ν = 0, interpreted as the limit of (1) as ν → 0, gives the exponential distribution, whilst

ν < 0 corresponds to a short-tailed distribution with ﬁnite upper end point u − ψ / ν, and

ν > 0 gives a power-law tail decay, heavier than that of a normal or gamma distribution.

2

This family of distributions arises as the only possible non-degenerate limit for scaled

excesses of a continuous random variable as the threshold tends to the upper end point

of the distribution (Pickands, 1975).

In practice, we assume that the limit has been

suﬃciently achieved above a large enough choice for u. Other than in hydrology, these

models are applied in a range of areas, e.g., climatology (Blanchet and Davison, 2011;

Reich et al., 2014) and ﬁnance (Chavez-Demoulin et al., 2014; Hilal et al., 2014). We focus

on modelling threshold exceedances, but we could have worked with an extremal mixture

model (Behrens et al., 2004; MacDonald et al., 2011) comprising separate distributions

for observations below and above u if the full distribution of X was of interest.

When ﬁtting extreme value models over a range of variables (e.g., the same physical

variable measured at diﬀerent sites, or diﬀerent variables measured at the same time), it

is natural to model the tails of the marginal distributions as GPD, with the parameters

(ψ, ν) potentially changing over variables. A range of methods have been used to cluster

the variables. Two broad approaches have emerged: methods that aim purely to ﬁnd

clusters of similarly distributed variables for purposes of interpretation; and methods

that aim to pool information over similarly distributed variables to enhance inference

eﬃciency. The ﬁrst category of methods tend to evaluate extreme value theory summary

statistics (e.g., the GPD shape parameter from each site) and apply widely used generic

clustering techniques (e.g., k-means or k-medoids (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 2005)) to

form clusters. Examples of such approaches include Rubio et al. (2018) for clustering

diﬀerent stocks based on extreme losses, and Bernard et al. (2013) and Bador et al.

(2015) who explore diﬀerent levels of pairwise dependence via clustering.

The latest approaches in the second category use hierarchical modelling. First versions

of these methods go back to the pooling methods used by the Flood Studies Report (1975)

(Institute of Hydrology (Great Britain), 1975) which selected a hydrologically coherent

region and assumed a common GPD shape parameter for all sites within the region. The

methods evolved to also account for the dependence structure (Coles and Tawn, 1990,

1996). These methods do not account for the uncertainty in the process of identifying

the regions/clusters of similar variables. The ﬁrst hierarchical method which accounted

3

for the cluster uncertainty in the inference for extremes was by Smith and Goodman

(2000), later extended to a Bayesian mixture model by Bottolo et al. (2003), who deﬁne a

Bayesian framework to borrow information across multiple types of independent insurance

claims in order to reduce uncertainty in the estimates of the parameters of the type-wise

GPD. For spatial extreme value problems hierarchical clustering models for the extremes

have been proposed by Carreau et al. (2017) and Reich and Shaby (2019), with both

approaches having limitations. The former does not account for dependence over space.

Although this feature is somewhat addressed by Reich and Shaby (2019), they model

dependence over variables in the same cluster with a restrictive exchangeable parametric

extreme value copula, which is likely to be too simplistic and as a consequence bias the

marginal inference (Dupuis and Tawn, 2001). Furthermore, the approach has a high

computational cost and it ﬁxes the number of clusters.

The existing methods for spatial clustering of extremes focus solely on criteria based

on the similarity of the marginal distributions, whereas others only consider dependence

features. No methods look at both aspects yet, from a physical perspective, spatial

dependence of a process is the key determinant of the marginal distributions being similar.

Furthermore, the vast majority of approaches both ignore the clustering uncertainty (both

numbers of clusters and the allocation of variables to clusters) and ignore the spatial

dependence between variables within a cluster in their marginal inference.

Our proposed approach is the ﬁrst to address all of these features in a single Bayesian

framework and it is applicable to both areal and geostatistical data. It learns about both

the number of clusters and their spatial structure with respect to the site-wise distribution

of the peaks-over threshold and spatial dependence in the extremes. Unlike Reich and

Shaby (2019) we do not attempt to estimate a full model for the spatial dependence

structure, instead, similar to Bernard et al. (2013), we account for dependence through a

widely used pairwise measure of extremal dependence (Coles et al., 1999). We introduce a

statistical model for the extremal dependence measure which incorporates both distance

between sites and our belief that sites within the same cluster tend to exhibit a higher

degree of dependence than sites in diﬀerent clusters. Our approach to impose spatial

4

structure on the parameters of the site-wise GPD is similar to Bottolo et al. (2003), but

the additional consideration of spatio-temporal dependence makes it a more general and

harder problem. Posterior samples are obtained using a reversible jump MCMC algorithm

(Green, 1995) which allows: the number of spatial clusters to vary, the analysis of the

site-wise marginal tail behaviour, and the derivation of a point estimate for the cluster

structure using Bayesian decision theory.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the motivating applications

and introduces the data; Sections 3 and 4 detail the statistical modelling framework and

the inference procedure; there is a simulation study in Section 5 and Section 6 presents

a data analysis for the applications; and we conclude with a discussion in Section 7.

2 Motivating examples and data

2.1 Weather-related property insurance claims in Norway

Insurance companies are interested in the distribution of the number of claims they are

likely to receive over diﬀerent areas as a consequence of rainfall and/or snow-melt. Scheel

et al. (2013) showed that the upper tail of this distribution is exceptionally diﬃcult to

model for individual administrative areas (termed municipalities) in Norway. Rohrbeck

et al. (2018) develop an extremal regression model that shows how the largest numbers

of insurance claims per weather event in a municipality can be clearly linked to extreme

precipitation in that municipality, and that from such a model, marginalizing over the

precipitation gives a good model for the marginal distribution of the number of claims.

While their approach achieves good results for three highly populated Norwegian mu-

nicipalities, its complexity requires a high number of insurance claims in order to obtain

reliable estimates. As this criterion is not satisﬁed by most Norwegian municipalities,

there is a need to exploit spatial structure to borrow information across municipalities

and instead model the total claims over clusters of municipalities. The question then

is what precipitation value to use and how to model that. Although the probability of

a claim given an extreme precipitation is likely to change very slowly over space, the

distribution of extreme precipitation varies more rapidly due to geographical reasons.

Therefore we need to identify clusters of municipalities which have both the same distri-

bution of extreme precipitation and have similar actual values in each extreme event (i.e.,

strong extremal dependence), so that the average precipitation over the cluster can be

used as a covariate for the aggregated claims across the municipalities within the cluster.

We consider precipitation across the 343 municipalities in South Norway. These areal

units, shown in Figure 1 left panel, diﬀer substantially in size, ranging from a few through

to several hundred square kilometres. The data were produced by the Norwegian Meteo-

rological Institute (www.met.no) and provide the daily amount of precipitation (in mm),

including both rain and snowfall, between 1997 and 2006. Data for each municipality are

obtained by a two-step process. First, point observations from more than 200 measure-

ment stations across Norway are spatially interpolated to a regular grid of 1km2. Then,

for each municipality, the precipitation is obtained by a weighted averaging over the grid

within the municipality’s boundary, with weights proportional to the population density

(Haug et al., 2011). The data exhibit a small number of missing values; 326 of the 343

municipalities have a full record and only six have more than 20 observations missing.

Figure 1 right panel shows substantial spatial variation in the average daily precip-

itation across municipalities. The highest average values are recorded along the west

coast and the averages decrease typically with increasing easterly coordinates and dis-

tance from the coast. All municipalities exhibit seasonality, with the largest average daily

precipitation typically in September and October, but with the west coast having higher

average precipitation levels in January to March, while these are the driest months, on

average, for the municipalities in the south-east.

To focus on the larger events, we explore the exceedances of a threshold, corresponding

to the annual 90% quantile for each municipality. For each municipality, the average

number of events exceeding the threshold varies across the year, however, the excess

values themselves are found not to exhibit seasonality. Similar results are found for all

higher thresholds. Thus site-wise peaks over threshold can be considered as identically

distributed over time but they do exhibit spatial variation.

2.2 Flood risk analysis for the UK

Improving river ﬂood risk analysis in the UK is of high priority given that it has ex-

perienced several severe and widespread ﬂood events over the past years. For instance,

an estimated economic damage of between £1.3–1.9 billion (Environment Agency, 2018).

Practitioners are interested in the potential size of future ﬂood events, as well as their

spatial extent. Detecting groups of sites which have similar dynamics in terms of extreme

river ﬂow levels helps to address this question as we can combine them in the inference

to improve statistical eﬃciency and hence produce estimates that give more reliable ex-

trapolations to rarer events. However, extreme rainfall events in diﬀerent seasons have

diﬀerent spatial characteristics due to frontal rainfall in summer and convective rainfall

in winter; so clusterings may diﬀer between seasons.

Daily mean river ﬂow levels (in m3/s) for the years 1980 to 2011 for 45 gauges are

obtained from the UK’s National River Flow Archive (nrfa.ceh.ac.uk) and cover north-

ern England and southern Scotland, with the majority being in North West England; see

Figure 2 left panel. Observations for several years are missing for two gauges and other

stations also exhibit some missing values. The data include the river ﬂow levels for the

ﬂoods in Cumbria in November 2009. Hydrological distances which account for catch-

ment closeness are available; these provide a better emulation of the spatial dependence

than the geographical distances (Asadi et al., 2015).

Figure 2 right panel indicates strong seasonality for one of the gauges, a feature typical

of all gauges in the region; the highest average river ﬂow levels are observed for November

through to March, while June through to August record the lowest averages. As such, a

river ﬂow level which is considered very high in summer may be rather standard in winter.

Moreover, the data exhibit strong autocorrelation. Therefore, an extreme weather event

may cause extreme river ﬂow levels over consecutive days. The data values vary substan-

tially across gauges; the site-wise daily average ranges from 0.2m3/s up to 54.9m3/s. All

these aspects, that is seasonality, spatio-temporal dependence and diﬀerence in scale, are

considered in our analysis in Section 6.

3.1

Introduction

Consider K sites with spatial locations s1, . . . , sK ∈ R2. For the Norwegian municipalities

in Section 2.1, sk (k = 1, . . . , K) refers to the centroid of the k-th areal unit (municipality).

In a geostatistical setting, sk is the point location of the k-th site; for instance, the latitude

and longitude of the k-th gauge in Section 2.2. Spatial proximity of any pair (k, k(cid:48)) of

sites is measured via a suitable metric which provides a distance dk,k(cid:48) ≥ 0 based on the

locations sk and sk(cid:48). For each of the K sites, we have data for the variable we wish to

draw inference on the distribution of its largest values.

The exploratory analysis in Section 2 shows that hydrological processes usually exhibit

seasonality and spatio-temporal dependencies. As such, observations may neither be

identically distributed nor independent. Firstly, we account for temporal dependence.

We use declustering prior to any model ﬁtting, with each of the K time series being split

into subperiods such that extremes occurring in diﬀerent subperiods can be assumed to

be independent (Ferro and Segers, 2003). We select the same set of subperiods for each

site and only use the highest observation per subperiod and site in our analysis. Our

methodology can be adapted to accommodate temporal lags between the same event at

diﬀerent sites but, in what follows, for notational simplicity, we present our method under

the assumption that extreme events aﬀecting multiple sites jointly have no time lag.

Let Rk,1, . . . , Rk,T denote the time series for site k (k = 1, . . . , K) after declustering,

i.e., Rk,t and Rk(cid:48),t(cid:48) are assumed to be independent for any t (cid:54)= t(cid:48) and all k and k(cid:48) including

k = k(cid:48); the record length T is taken to be equal across sites for simplicity. If sk and sk(cid:48)

are close together, corresponding to dk,k(cid:48) being small, it is reasonable to assume that the

marginal distributions for Rk,t and Rk(cid:48),t should be the same, or very similar, therefore

they should have similar GPD parameter values in (1). Spatial dependence leads to the

same extreme event being present at diﬀerent sites, again with the occurrence rate for

such events likely to increase if dk,k(cid:48) is small, i.e., if Rk,t is large then the chances of

Rk(cid:48),t being large increases if sk and sk(cid:48) are close, relative to them being further apart. In

9

Section 3.3 we introduce a pairwise extremal dependence measure, χk,k(cid:48), between sites k

and k(cid:48) that captures this feature.

Our approach is to group sites into clusters such that sites in the same cluster have

both similar marginal distributions and the spatial dependence is greater between sites

in the same cluster than between sites in diﬀerent clusters. To represent the cluster

structure, we introduce K latent random variables Z = (Z1, . . . , ZK). Let J ∈ {1, . . . , K}

denote the number of clusters. Then, for each k = 1, . . . , K, Zk ∈ {1, . . . , J} with Zk = j

corresponding to the k-th site being allocated to the j-th cluster. Conditional on Z,

we propose separate models for the marginal distributions of Rk,t and the dependence

measures χk,k(cid:48) in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 respectively. We later combine these models in

Section 4.

3.2 Model for Marginal Clustering

We model the site-wise tail behaviour using the GPD model (1) for threshold exceedances.

Our data in Section 2 indicates that Rk,1, . . . , Rk,T are not identically distributed due to

seasonality. There are a range of established approaches to handle this: to split the

time series into shorter time periods for which the assumption of stationarity seems

reasonable; model the threshold and GPD parameters in terms of a set of temporal

predictors (Davison and Smith, 1990; Chavez-Demoulin and Davison, 2005); to preprocess

the data to remove non-stationary to the overall series, via the Box-Cox transformation

(Eastoe and Tawn, 2009). We will discuss the combination of these methods for our

approach in more detail in Sections 6 and 7. However, for simplicity, when presenting

the methods we assume that Rk,1, . . . , Rk,T are identically distributed.

For site k, given a high enough threshold uk, we model Rk,t − uk | (Rk,t > uk) as

following a GPD(ψk, νk). The selection of the threshold uk in (1) is highly important.

If uk is too high, estimates for ψk and νk are based on a small number of data points.

Conversely, the distribution of Rk,t − uk | (Rk,t > uk) may not be well approximated by a

GPD if uk is too low. In many applications, uk is selected using graphical diagnostic tools

with the mean residual life and threshold stability plots being the most common ones

10

(Coles, 2001). More recent techniques are described by Wadsworth (2016) and Northrop

et al. (2017).

For clustering we group sites that have a very similar marginal tail behaviour. There-

fore, the peaks-over threshold for all the sites within a cluster are modelled by a GPD

with the same scale and shape parameters. The distribution of the peaks-over threshold

for the k-th site (k = 1, . . . , K), conditional on Zk, is thus given by

Rk,t − uk | (Zk = j , Rk,t > uk) ∼ GPD (σj , ξj) ,

(2)

where σj > 0 and ξj ∈ R (j = 1, . . . , J) denote the cluster-speciﬁc scale and shape

parameters, therefore (ψk, νk) = (σj, ξj) if Zk = j. We denote the parameters of the
M = (cid:8)σ(J), ξ(J)(cid:9), where σ(J) = (σ1, . . . , σJ ) and ξ(J) = (ξ1, . . . , ξJ ).

model given Z by θ(J)

3.3 Model for Spatial Dependence Clustering

There are a number of ways for modelling dependence in multivariate and spatial ex-

tremes. Multivariate approaches have included ﬁtting parametric models for multivariate

extreme value copula (Tawn, 1988) and various threshold methods (Ledford and Tawn,

1997; Ferreira and de Haan, 2014; Rootzén et al., 2018). In a spatial context, max-stable

processes are the most widely used (Davison et al., 2012; Reich and Shaby, 2012; Asadi

et al., 2015). Such processes arise as the limit of component-wise maxima of suitably

normalized replications of a spatial process (de Haan, 1984) and multiple parametric rep-

resentations have been proposed (Davison et al., 2012). However, they have a number of

inference and model limitations. Inference issues are mostly overcome by instead using

Pareto processes (Ferreira and de Haan, 2014; Dombry and Ribatet, 2015); however these

models give either a strong form of extremal dependence (corresponding to χk,k(cid:48) > 0 in

(3)) across all sites or give independence. Alternative methods that allow for spatial

dependence that weakens with extremal level also exist (Wadsworth and Tawn, 2012,

2018).

None of these methods has both the suﬃcient ﬂexibility and ease of implementation

11

to be applied reliably to problems of the dimension of those in Section 2. Therefore,

instead of attempting to model the full joint distribution over the extreme events at the

sites, we model the core summary statistics for pairwise extremal dependence. The most

widely used extremal dependence measure is the coeﬃcient of asymptotic dependence χ

(Coles et al., 1999). Formally, for the random variables Rk and Rk(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , K),

χk,k(cid:48) = limu→1 χk,k(cid:48)(u) where

χk,k(cid:48)(u) = P [ Fk(Rk) > u | Fk(cid:48)(Rk(cid:48)) > u ] ,

u ∈ [0, 1],

(3)

with Fk(·) and Fk(cid:48)(·) denoting the cumulative distribution functions of Rk and Rk(cid:48), re-

spectively. Thus χk,k(cid:48) ∈ [0, 1] gives the limit probability of site k observing an extreme

event conditional on site k(cid:48) recording one. There are strong parallels between χk,k(cid:48) and

the extremogram (Davis and Mikosch, 2009) at distance dk,k(cid:48), with the key diﬀerence be-

ing that inference for the extremogram pools together all the data from pairs of sites with

the same separation under the assumption of stationarity. When χk,k(cid:48) > 0, Rk and Rk(cid:48)

are termed asymptotically dependent, with increasing values corresponding to stronger

extremal dependence, whilst we say that Rk and Rk(cid:48) are asymptotically independent if

χk,k(cid:48) = 0. Asymptotic dependence can, for instance, arise when the conditions for bi-

variate regular variation hold (Resnick, 2013), while random variables with a Gaussian

copula are asymptotically independent unless they are perfectly dependent.

Before attempting to specify the model for the distribution of χk,k(cid:48), conditional on Z,

consider what properties the expected value of this conditional distribution should pos-

sess. Since sites (k, k(cid:48)) within the same cluster are expected to have a higher probability

of joint extreme events, χk,k(cid:48) | Z should be larger for Zk = Zk(cid:48) than when Zk (cid:54)= Zk(cid:48). We

express this assumption via the constraint

E (χk,k(cid:48) | Zk = Zk(cid:48)) ≥ E (χk,k(cid:48) | Zk (cid:54)= Zk(cid:48)) .

(4)

Furthermore, the pairwise extremal dependence between the sites k and k(cid:48), irrespective of

whether the sites are in the same cluster or not, should decrease with increasing distance

12

dk,k(cid:48). We assume that the expectation of χk,k(cid:48) decays exponentially with dk,k(cid:48), but with

a varying rate across each cluster and with a common, but faster, decay rate between

clusters. These properties are reﬂected in the formulation

E (χk,k(cid:48) | Z) =






exp (−γj dk,k(cid:48))

if Zk = Zk(cid:48) = j,

exp (−γ0 dk,k(cid:48))

if Zk (cid:54)= Zk(cid:48),

(5)

where γj > 0 (j = 1, . . . , J) is a cluster-speciﬁc parameter and γ0 > max(γ1, . . . , γJ ) ≥ 0.

This approach is consistent with χk,k = 1 (k = 1, . . . , K) and constraint (4), and allows

for non-stationarity of the process as γi and γj, i (cid:54)= j ≥ 1, can diﬀer. We ensure that

γ0 > max(γ1, . . . , γJ ) by deﬁning parameters (cid:15)1, . . . , (cid:15)J such that

log (γj) = log(γ0) − (cid:15)j,

(cid:15)j ≥ 0,

(j = 1, . . . , J).

(6)

Now consider the distribution of χk,k(cid:48) | Z. As χk,k(cid:48) ∈ [0, 1] may diﬀer between two

pairs of sites in the same cluster with the same dk,k(cid:48), due to factors such as topology, we

choose a beta distribution model with

χk,k(cid:48) | Z ∼

(7)

which has expectation given by (5) and where β > 0 controls the variance of χk,k(cid:48); higher

values of β correspond to χk,k(cid:48) being less variable. Consequently, the spatial variation

of the set of coeﬃcients of asymptotic dependence, conditional on Z, is deﬁned via the

J + 2 parameters γ0, (cid:15)(J) = ((cid:15)1, . . . , (cid:15)J ) and β, and we denote the dependence parameters

given Z by θ(J)

D = (γ0, (cid:15)(J), β).

The distribution (7) could be applied to model χk,k(cid:48) for all pairs of sites (k, k(cid:48)). How-

ever, this may not be optimal. For Zk (cid:54)= Zk(cid:48), χk,k(cid:48) may vary strongly, depending on

whether sites k and k(cid:48) belong to adjacent clusters or whether there are multiple clusters

along the path between the two sites. Such diﬀerences can probably not be captured by

13

the single parameter γ0. We thus consider χk,k(cid:48) for adjacent pairs of sites only. In case

of the sites being point locations, we ﬁrst derive the Voronoi partition of the study area

and then deﬁne sites as being adjacent if their corresponding Voronoi cells are adjacent.

4 Bayesian Inference

4.1

Introduction

We use Bayesian inference for the number of clusters, J, the latent variables Z, and the

marginal and dependence structure parameters θ(J)

M and θ(J)

D using the declustered data

D = { (rk,1, . . . , rk,T ) : k = 1, . . . , K }. The posterior, and the algorithm to sample from

it, are developed in this section. The derivation of the marginal and dependence structure

likelihood contributions LM and LD, given Z and D, are provided in Section 4.2. Critically,

the data that are used to analyze the marginal and dependence structures are diﬀerent, in

that for marginal distributions we use all marginal exceedances of a threshold at all sites,

whereas for the dependence model, only ranks of the variables are used. These two forms

of the data are only weakly dependent. Furthermore, Genest et al. (1995) and Genest and

Segers (2009) have shown that inference for dependence parameters is largely unaﬀected

by marginal parameter estimation. Therefore we use the following approximation to the

However, spatial independence is not a valid assumption for our motivating problems since

severe weather events usually aﬀect a number of sites (municipalities/gauges). Therefore,

the likelihood function in expression (9) corresponds to a misspeciﬁed model. Under suit-

able regularity conditions, Kent (1982) shows that a general theory for the asymptotic

distribution of the maximum likelihood estimate ˆθ(J)

and then the classic asymptotic result is obtained. Inference un-

correspond to credible intervals of the parameters being too narrow.

We follow an approach of Ribatet et al. (2012), who propose an adjustment of the

curvature of the likelihood (9) around its mode using the asymptotic behaviour in ex-

pression (10). The adjusted likelihood is

diagonal matrix consisting of J lots of 2 × 2 blocks, each block corresponds to one cluster

(i.e. for the j-th block this corresponds to the terms for σj and ξj); this feature enables

eﬃcient computation of B.

imum likelihood estimate relative to using likelihood Lind

to be consistent with (10) when there is spatial dependence, and leaving the inference

unchanged from using likelihood Lind

4.2.2 Dependence component

With χk,k(cid:48)(u) deﬁned as in expression (3), we assume that there exists a value 0 ≤ ˜u < 1

such that χk,k(cid:48)(u) = χk,k(cid:48), i.e., it is equal to its limit form, for all ˜u < u < 1 and for all pairs

of sites (k, k(cid:48)). Techniques for the selection of ˜u, for a pair (k, k(cid:48)), are available (de Haan

and de Ronde, 1998; Wan and Davis, 2019). Our data for estimating χk,k(cid:48) are derived from

exceedances of the 100˜u% quantiles at sites k and k(cid:48), as determined by their respective

empirical distribution estimates ˆFk and ˆFk(cid:48). First let Qk,k(cid:48) =

(cid:110)

(cid:111)
t : ˆFk(cid:48)(rk(cid:48),t) > ˜u

, be the

set of times when there is both an exceedance of the quantile threshold at site k(cid:48) and

the data for site k are available, and let Qk,k(cid:48) = |Qk,k(cid:48)| denote the cardinality of this set.

Further let

Pk,k(cid:48) = #

(cid:110)
t ∈ Qk,k(cid:48) : ˆFk(rk,t) > ˜u

(cid:111)

,

k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , K.

(13)

16

Then it follows that Pk,k(cid:48) is distributed as

Pk,k(cid:48) | χk,k(cid:48) ∼ Binomial ( Qk,k(cid:48) , χk,k(cid:48) ).

(14)

In the absence of knowledge of our model in Section 3.3 for χk,k(cid:48) over sites, the estimate

for χk,k(cid:48) is given by

ˆχk,k(cid:48) =

Pk,k(cid:48)
Qk,k(cid:48)

,

(15)

which, if there were no missing data, is simply the proportion of the exceedances of the

100˜u% for site k(cid:48) that also exceed this quantile threshold for site k. So estimator (15)

is an extension of the standard estimator for χk,k(cid:48). Note that due to the missing data

this estimator has the property that ˆχk,k(cid:48) does not necessarily equal ˆχk(cid:48),k even though

χk,k(cid:48) = χk(cid:48),k.

By combining (14) and the information about χk,k(cid:48), from our cluster model (7), and

then integrating over χk,k(cid:48), we obtain that Pk,k(cid:48) | (D, Z) follows a beta-binomial distribu-

tion of the form

Pk,k(cid:48) | D, Z ∼

Following the discussion in Section 3.3 this model is assumed to hold only for pairs

of sites (k, k(cid:48)) which are adjacent. We let k ∼ k(cid:48) denote the distinct pairs of sites (k, k(cid:48))

which are adjacent. Denote the density function of the beta-binomial distribution in (16)

as critically we have two estimates for χk,k(cid:48) which contain almost exactly the same infor-

mation, each of equal value, and so we weight both observations by 0.5.

Under an assumption of independence of distinct pairs, the likelihood function for the

(cid:89)

k∼k(cid:48)

(17)

This likelihood is misspeciﬁed since {Pk,k(cid:48) : k (cid:54)= k(cid:48)} are not independently distributed;

for instance, when there is no missing data, if Pk,k(cid:48) and Pk,k(cid:48)(cid:48) are very large, then Pk(cid:48),k(cid:48)(cid:48)

cannot be small. We could use the Ribatet et al. (2012) adjustment again but we opted

against it due to the following reasons. Firstly, in our data examples, the values for Pk,k(cid:48)

are not so close to Qk,k(cid:48) as that the eﬀect is very strong. Secondly, we are not directly

interested in the marginal posterior distributions of θ(J)

D and as for our posterior, given Z

and D, θ(J)

M and θ(J)

D are independent. Finally, the observed information matrix which we

would require for the curvature adjustment is dense due to the parameter β being present

in all terms of the likelihood function and of dimension (J + 2) × (J + 2). Therefore, we

would have to invert a potentially high-dimensional matrix, which leads to a substantial

computational cost, in particular, since we have to compute this matrix many times.

4.3 Priors

To perform Bayesian inference, we specify priors for the number of clusters J, the cluster

labels Z | J, and the model parameters θ(J)

M and θ(J)

D . Since J ≥ 1, we deﬁne J − 1 ∼

Poisson(κ) and set a weakly informative Gamma prior for κ, κ ∼ Gamma(1, 0.001).

We wish to impose that clusters are contiguous; otherwise, two sites which are far

apart may be grouped together, despite the probability of them jointly facing an extreme

event being close to zero. Our prior is similar to Knorr-Held and Raßer (2000) and only

gives positive mass to contiguous clusters. The idea is to represent the spatial structure

of the J clusters via a set of centres C(J) = (C1, . . . , CJ ) ∈ {1, . . . , K}, Ci (cid:54)= Cj if i (cid:54)= j;

Ci = j corresponds to sj being the centre of the i-th cluster. Each site k is assigned to

the closest cluster centre in terms of dk,k(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , K), i.e., we take

Zk | C(J) = arg min
j=1,...,J

dk,Cj .

(18)

18

To ensure that Z | C(J) is well-deﬁned, the site k is allocated to the cluster with lowest

index if multiple cluster centres have minimum distance to the site. Relationship (18)

implies that we can assign a prior for Z | J via one for C(J). We choose a uniform prior

with

P (cid:0)C(J) | J(cid:1) =

(K − J)!
K!

.

We conclude by assigning priors for the parameters θ(J)

M and θ(J)

D . For the GPD param-

eters in (2), a log-normal prior is deﬁned for the scale parameter, σj ∼ Lognormal(µσ, θσ),

while a normal prior is set for the shape parameter, ξj ∼ Normal(µξ, θξ) (j = 1, . . . , J).

The priors for the parameters describing the spatial dependence are deﬁned as expo-

nentially distributed. Speciﬁcally, (cid:15)j ∼ Exponential (θ(cid:15)) , γ0 ∼ Exponential(0.001) and

β ∼ Exponential(0.01). The exponential prior for (cid:15)j represents a prior preference to

small spatial diﬀerences in the extremal dependence. To complete the model setup,

we specify independent conjugate priors for the hyperparameters: µσ ∼ Normal(0, 1),

µξ ∼ Normal(0, 0.2), θσ, θξ ∼ Inverse-Gamma(1, 0.1) and θ(cid:15) ∼ Gamma(5, 2).

4.4

Implementation

We wish to sample from the posterior distribution deﬁned by the likelihood function

(8) and the prior distributions in Sections 4.3. Since the dimension of the parameter

space changes with the number J of clusters, we use a reversible jump MCMC algorithm

(RJMCMC) (Green, 1995). Given a current sample with J clusters, we propose one of

the following seven moves:

Birth: Introduce a new cluster centre C ∗ with parameters (cid:15)∗, σ∗ and ξ∗.

Death: Remove one of the existing cluster centres C1, . . . , CJ . Sites previously allocated

to the removed cluster are assigned to the other J − 1 clusters according to (18).

Shift: Move one of the cluster centres to a nearby site which is not a cluster centre and

update the cluster labels Z | J according to (18).

Sigma: Update the scale parameters σ(J) of the GPD in (2).

19

Xi: Update the shape parameters ξ(J) of the GPD in (2).

Chi: Update (cid:15)(J), γ0 and β in (16).

Hyper: Update the hyperparameters κ, (µσ, µξ) and (θσ, θξ, θ(cid:15)).

The birth and death move are comparable to the split and merge moves deﬁned in other

Bayesian clustering approaches, see Bottolo et al. (2003) for instance, but they potentially

aﬀect more than one cluster. For the examples in Sections 5 and 6, birth, death and shift

are proposed with probability 0.2 each while the remaining four moves are each proposed

with probability 0.1.

We brieﬂy describe some features of our implementation and more details are provided

in Appendix A. For a birth move, the new cluster centre C ∗ is uniformly sampled from

one of the K −J sites which are not currently cluster centres. In addition to C ∗, the index

at which to insert C ∗ in the vector CJ is sampled with equal probability. The proposal

distributions for the cluster parameters (cid:15)∗, σ∗ and ξ∗ are close to the priors in Section 4.3

but some spatial information is incorporated; in particular, the mean of the proposal

distribution is set to a average of the current parameter values of the sites allocated to

the new cluster, while the variance of the proposal distribution is set to the prior variance.

A death move ensures reversibility and one of the existing J cluster centres is removed

with equal probability. If J = 1, the death move is rejected immediately. A shift move

reallocates an existing cluster centre to one of the adjacent sites which are not currently

cluster centres; this changes neither the cluster parameters nor the indexing of the cluster

centres. Note, the matrix B in expression (11) has to be updated in the case of a birth,

death or shift move; due to B being a block diagonal matrix, we only have to update the

2 × 2 blocks of the clusters which are aﬀected by the proposal. The model parameters in

M and θ(J)
θ(J)

D are updated via a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm, while we sample from

the corresponding full conditional distributions when updating the hyperparameters.

20

4.5 Analysis of the posterior samples

Interest lies in the marginal distributions of the peaks-over threshold and the underlying

spatial cluster structure. Suppose that we generated N posterior samples as described in

Section 4.4 and let Z (i)

k be the cluster label for site k in the i-th sample (i = 1, . . . , N ). To

obtain a point estimate for the cluster structure, we ﬁrst derive the posterior probability

of sites k and k(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , K) being in the same cluster. This gives S ∈ [0, 1]K×K

with (k, k(cid:48)) entry

(19)

We estimate the cluster structure using the Bayesian decision theoretical approach by

Wade and Ghahramani (2018), provided in the mcclust.ext R package (Wade, 2015).

They derive a point estimate for the cluster structure based on the variation of information

criterion (Meilˇa, 2007) which was originally introduced for comparing clusterings.

The marginal distributions can be estimated by Monte Carlo integration. For instance,

the posterior mean estimate for ψk is

ˆψk =

σ(i)

(20)

where σ(i)

is the cluster-speciﬁc scale parameter for cluster Z (i)

k . Similarly, we obtain

credible intervals for the GPD scale and shape parameters. We refer to this approach as

site-wise Monte Carlo integration (SWMC); this site-wise estimation is usually done in

Bayesian cluster analysis.

For illustration and comparison purposes, we consider a second approach to estimate

the marginal distributions based on the posterior samples; we later apply it in Section 6.

The estimate ﬁrst imposes the spatial clusters and then estimates the GPD cluster pa-

rameters using the likelihood Ladj

M (·) in (11). We ﬁx the clusters as the point estimate

above and assume sites within a cluster to have the same scale and shape parameter (as it

is done in many regional hazard models). Let J ∗ denote the estimated number of clusters

and let C1, . . . , CJ ∗ be such that Cj contains the sites allocated to the j-th cluster in the

21

point estimate. We then consider the posterior (σ(J ∗), ξ(J ∗) | Z∗, D), where Z∗ represents

C1, . . . , CJ ∗. Posterior samples are generated using our implementation in Section 4.4 with

birth, death and shift being proposed with zero probability. The cluster-speciﬁc param-

eters (σj, ξj) for cluster j (j = 1, . . . , J ∗) are then estimated by Monte Carlo integration

with

ˆσj =

1
N

,

where N is the sampled number of parameter values for (σj, ξj). Then, ˆψk = ˆσj and
ˆνk = ˆξj for each site k in cluster Cj. We refer to this approach as cluster-wise Monte

Carlo integration (CWMC).

Return levels are an important quantity to characterize extremal behaviour. The

τ -year return level is the value which is exceeded on average once every τ years. For

Rk,t − uk | (Rk,t > uk) ∼ GPD(ψk, νk), the τ -year return level of Rk,t is

uk +

ψk
νk

[ (λu τ )νk − 1 ] ,

(21)

where λu is the expected number of times Rk,t exceeds uk per year. We obtain posterior

median return levels similarly to the GPD parameters in (20).

5 Simulation Examples

We consider the K = 20 areal units in Figure 3 which correspond to a set of municipal-

ities in south-east Norway. The distance dk,k(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , 20) is computed using the

coordinates of the municipalities’ centroids and by accounting for the earth’s curvature.

Distances are standardized such that 0 ≤ dk,k(cid:48) ≤ 1. The marginal distributions are set

to Rk,t ∼ GPD(ψk, νk) (k = 1, . . . , 20; t = 1, . . . , 100); we set uk = 0 and thus obtain 100

threshold excesses per site for analysis. Data for the extremal dependence are simulated

independently from the threshold excesses. We ﬁx Qk,k(cid:48) = 20 (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , 20) and sam-

ple Pk,k(cid:48) from the beta-binomial distribution (14). Posteriors for the spatial clusters and

model parameters herein are based on running the RJMCMC algorithm in Section 4.4 for

22

Figure 3: Map of areal units in Section 4.

106 iterations with the initial number of clusters set to J = 5; the ﬁrst 5 × 105 iterations

are discarded as burn-in and then every 100-th sample is stored for analysis.

Our methodology aims at identifying the spatial cluster structure and estimating the

marginal distributions. The simulation study illustrates the performance of our approach

with respect to these key aspects. Studies 1 and 2 consider the case of all sites having

the same marginal distribution and common pairwise extremal dependence structure, i.e.

J = 1. The studies diﬀer in that the data are independent (strongly correlated) in Study 1

(Study 2). By investigating the case J = 1, we check whether our approach tends to the

parsimonious estimate J = 1 or the extreme case J = 20, i.e., each site forms its own

cluster. Study 3 then considers the case of J = 3 clusters with the cluster formulation

shown in Figure 3, with spatially independent and dependent data in each cluster.

Study 1: The marginal GPD parameters are ψk = 2 and νk = 0.1 (k = 1, . . . , 20), and

the spatial dependence parameters are γ1 = 2 and β = 10; we do not specify γ0 since

J = 1. The posterior has J = 1 for 98% of the sample and the point estimate for the

cluster structure allocates all sites to the same cluster. The 90% credible intervals for

the site-wise GPD parameters ψk and νk are (1.9, 2.2) and (0.06, 0.13) respectively for all

sites. To illustrate the beneﬁts of pooling information spatially, we estimate the GPD

parameters for the municipality with index k = 4 (Fredrikstad) only using the simulated

threshold excesses for this site via a random walk Metropolis algorithm; this gives 90%

credible intervals of (1.8, 2.8) and (−0.06, 0.24) for ψ4 and ν4 respectively. Consequently,

our approach correctly identiﬁes the underlying spatial cluster structure and improves

estimates for the marginal distributions in this case.

Study 2: For the data as generated in Study 1, we induce strong spatial correlation by

matching ranks across sites, i.e., the m-th highest observation (m = 1, . . . , 100) occurs

simultaneously at all sites. The posterior probability of J = 1 is 0.92 and we again recover

the underlying cluster structure. The credible intervals for ψk and νk (k = 1, . . . , 20) are

(1.5, 2.4) and (−0.05, 0.28), and thus wider than in Study 1, as expected given there

is less information in the pooled data than in Study 1 due to the strong correlation.

Furthermore, the width of the credible intervals is very similar to the ones when estimating

ψ4 and ν4 solely based on the observations for site k = 4 in Study 1; so we obtain almost

no additional information due to the strong spatial dependence, apart from the centre

of the credible interval being closer to the true value. The latter feature arises as our

method pools information across the cluster while only data from site 4 is used to estimate

(ψ4, ν4).

speciﬁc GPD parameters σ = (2.0, 2.3, 2.6) and ξ = (0.05, 0.10, 0.15). The dependence

parameters are γ0 = 3, γj = 2 (j = 1, 2, 3) and β = 10; Figure 4 left panel shows the

empirical estimates ˆχk,k(cid:48) = Pk,k(cid:48)/Qk,k(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , 20) for χk,k(cid:48). The matrix S, given by

expression (19), shown in Figure 4 right panel indicates that J = 3 clusters are present;

S has the form of a block diagonal matrix with each block only containing entries of

high probability. One may conclude that, for instance, the sites 1-5 form a cluster; this

would be correct given Figure 3. Indeed, the point estimate for the spatial clusters is

identical to the true cluster formulation in Figure 3. The 90% central credible interval

for the number J of clusters is (2,7), and the true marginal GPD parameters lie within

the estimated 90% central credible interval for all sites. We then generate dependent

data using a Gaussian copula and the GPD marginals above. Again, the spatial cluster

structure is correctly identiﬁed and the spatial dependence leads to a higher uncertainty

on the site-wise GPD parameters (results not shown).

6 Data analysis

We now apply our methodology to analyze the data described in Section 2. After an

appropriate burn-in period, we perform 1.5 × 107 iterations of the RJMCMC sampling

scheme in Section 4.4, with every 1000-th sample being stored. Initially, 10% of the sites

are cluster centres. The acceptance probabilities for birth (and death) were 0.02 and 0.05

for the data in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 respectively. Our C++ implementation took about 40

minutes per 106 iterations on a standard laptop for the larger data set in Section 6.1.

6.1 Daily precipitation in South Norway

Since an extreme event may be split across two days, we consider the aggregated amount

of precipitation over a 48-hour period. Further, we decluster by using only the highest

observation per week because consecutive observations are strongly correlated; this gives

about 500 observations per municipality. We then select a threshold uk (k = 1, . . . , 343)

for which Rk,t − uk | Rk,t > uk approximately follows a GPD. Analysis of the threshold

stability plots suggests to set uk to the empirical 92.5% quantile; this gives about 40

peaks-over threshold per municipality. The empirical measures Pk,k(cid:48) and Qk,k(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) =

credible interval is (29, 37). The point-estimate for the spatial cluster structure comprises

30 clusters which are illustrated in Figure 6 left panel. Most clusters contain between

7 and 16 municipalities; two clusters located in western and southern Norway contain

only two municipalities while the cluster in the south-east includes more than 40, mostly

small, areal units. The derived spatial clusters agree with known climatology. Clusters

along the west coast regularly observe very high amounts of precipitation which are often

related to the Gulf Stream. We also ﬁnd that the drier municipalities in central Norway

are grouped together.

To investigate the eﬀect of exploiting information on both marginal tail behaviour and

extremal dependence, we consider a second spatial clustering algorithm with likelihood

function LM(θ(J)

spatial dependence is ignored, except via the adjustment (11). The sampled number of

clusters is higher than for our approach; the posterior mean for J is 39 with 80% credible

interval (33,45). Figure 6 right panel shows the point-estimate for the spatial clusters;

seven clusters contain ﬁve or less municipalities while three clusters include more than 20

municipalities. The highest observations per municipality for the most northern cluster in

Figure 6 ranges from 57.3mm through to 174.2mm in comparison to (94.5mm, 174.2mm)

for our approach. As such, our proposal to incorporate both marginal distributions

and extremal dependence seems to produce more realistic clusters than the considered

alternative.

We conclude the analysis by estimating return levels for the four municipalities high-

lighted in Figure 6: Fredrikstad (F), Lillehammer (L), Stavanger (S) and Trondheim (T).

The selected municipalities diﬀer in both climate and clustering; Fredikstad and Trond-

heim lie in large clusters while Stavanger and Lillehammer are members of relatively

small clusters. Since uk is the 92.5% quantile, the average number of exceedances per

year in (21) is λu = 52(1 − 0.925) = 3.9. We consider three approaches to estimate return

levels. For the ﬁrst estimate, we obtain return level estimates individually using only

the observed peaks-over threshold of the municipality, i.e., estimates are based on the

40 observed threshold excesses for the municipality. Our other estimates are based on

SWMC and CWMC as described in Section 4.5.

Table 1 shows that SWMC and CWMC provide shorter credible intervals for the con-

sidered municipalities than method (i); the central 90% credible interval for both method

(ii) and (iii) always lies within the credible interval of method (i). The credible intervals

obtained by SWMC and CWMC are very similar for Lillehammer and Trondheim; this

indicates that our point estimate for the cluster structure groups municipalities which

have indeed very similar marginal distributions. We further see that CWMC produces

shorter credible intervals than SWMC for Fredrikstad; this arises as the SWMC ap-

proach accounts for cluster uncertainty. In the CWMC method, the cluster containing

Fredrikstad contains many municipalities and spatial variation in the GPD parameters is

oversmoothed due to the cluster structure being ﬁxed; this can be seen in Table 1 since

the credible interval for method (iii) does not contain the posterior median derived by

method (i). The SWMC approach, on the other hand, performs better since the munic-

ipalities within this cluster are regularly split across smaller clusters; this allows for a

good exploration of the parameter space. Finally, the CWMC credible interval is similar

to method (i) for Stavanger while SWMC gives a narrower credible interval. The cluster

containing Stavanger is relatively small in size and an extreme event usually aﬀects most

municipalities within the cluster. Due to this strong spatial correlation, we obtain little

additional information by pooling information across the ﬁxed cluster. Conversely, our

SWMC approach eﬃciently pools information from a larger set of municipalities because

the cluster structure is allowed to change.

6.2 Daily river ﬂow in the UK

The data described in Section 2.2 exhibit a strong seasonal pattern for all K = 45 gauges.

We consider separately the maximum weekly river ﬂow for November-March and May-

September for which in each case the assumption of stationarity seems reasonable. The

observations in each season are then standardized site-wise to mean 0 and variance 1;

while this aﬀects the scale parameter ψk of the GPD in (1), it is well known that this

leaves the shape parameter νk unchanged.

A common threshold across all gauges, u1 = u2 · · · = uK, is selected individually for

the two seasons, giving between 25 and 40 peaks-over threshold per season for most sites.

The threshold ˜u in (15) is set to ˜u = 0.96 for November-March and ˜u = 0.95 for May-

September. This gives Qk,k(cid:48) ≈ 35 (25) for most pairs of sites (k, k(cid:48)) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , 45)

over the summer (winter) seasons. Here, the distance dk,k(cid:48) between sites (k, k(cid:48)) is set to

their hydrological distance (Section 2) which we scale such that 0 ≤ dk,k(cid:48) ≤ 1.

ure 7 indicate that the number of clusters is higher for May-September than for November-

March; the 80% credible intervals are (5,9) and (3,8). This result agrees with known

climatology. Extreme river ﬂows in winter in the UK are often caused by extratropical

cyclones which aﬀect larger areas; we thus expect larger clusters for November-March

than for May-September.

Figure 8 left panels show the imposed adjacency structure and the derived seasonal

clusters with respect to the hydrological coordinates of the gauges. The width of the lines

in the plots further illustrates that some gauges, which are allocated to diﬀerent clusters in

the point estimate, are also often grouped in the same cluster; see, for instance, the central

and southern cluster for November-March. We see an interesting match between the point

estimates of the underlying cluster structure for the two seasons. The southern cluster

for November-March splits into two equally-sized clusters in May-September. Similarly,

the other large cluster (green) for the winter season splits into two clusters in summer.

We then consider the geographical locations in Figure 8 right panels for further anal-

ysis. Beyond the seasonal pattern of the clusters, it is also interesting to investigate how

these compare to the underlying river networks; the estimated clusters are in fact not

identical to the river networks. For instance, we have ﬁve gauges for the River Tyne

in North-East England but only four of these are allocated to the same cluster (the

red cluster for the summer season). Finally, we note that some clusters are split along

administrative boundaries, in particular, in winter.

To conclude, we estimate return levels for τ = (100, 500) for the two gauges highlighted

in Figure 8 top-right panel: Kirkby Stephen (K) and Marple Bridge (M). Kirkby Stephen

was selected because multiple of its adjacent sites are allocated to diﬀerent clusters, while

Maple Bridge lies centrally in the southern cluster in winter and at the edge of the most

southern cluster in the summer season. We consider the same inference approaches as in

31

Section 6.1. Table 2 shows that SWMC again produces narrower credible intervals than

model (i). Furthermore, the weaknesses of the CWMC approach described in Section 6.1

aﬀect the estimates strongly, in particular, for Marple Bridge and winter.

7 Discussion

We introduced a Bayesian clustering approach which groups geographical sites based

on their marginal tail behaviour and their extremal dependence. The likelihood for the

peaks-over threshold accounts for the spatial dependence usually found in hydrological

applications. Our model for the extremal dependence postulates that sites within the

same cluster exhibit higher pairwise extremal dependence than sites in diﬀerent clusters,

and that the degree of dependence decreases with an increasing distance between sites.

Clusters are represented by their centre, which imposes them to be contiguous and leads

to a good computational performance. Samples from the posterior distribution were

obtained using a reversible jump MCMC algorithm. A point-estimate for the spatial

cluster structure was derived from the pairwise posterior probabilities of sites being in

the same cluster using Bayesian decision theory.

We applied our approach to analyze precipitation levels across South Norway and

the derived clusters agree with climatology; these clusters will be used to analyze the

association between weather events and property insurance claims. The cluster approach

was further applied to river ﬂow data in the UK. We found that clusters are not identical

to the river networks and that the spatial extent of extreme river ﬂow levels is larger over

winter than summer. The results also showed that our approach eﬃciently pools spatial

information to impoove return level estimates.

There are various ways to extend the model presented in this paper. Firstly, we model

extremal dependence of a pair of adjacent sites (k, k(cid:48)) in diﬀerent clusters via the single

parameter γ0. Instead of γ0 being constant in (5), γ0 may be deﬁned as a function of

the cluster-speciﬁc parameters. Consider a pair of adjacent sites (k, k(cid:48)) with Zk = j

and Zk(cid:48) = j(cid:48), j (cid:54)= j(cid:48). High values of γj and γj(cid:48) may then imply a high value for γ0.

32

Another possible extension is the consideration of temporal variations in the distribution

of the peaks-over threshold and/or the extremal dependence. Such an extension should

then also allow for a potential change of the spatial cluster structure across seasons; the

results for the UK river ﬂow data indicate the presence of such a temporal variation in

the number of clusters.

Birth and death

Suppose we currently have J clusters with centres C(J) ⊆ {1, . . . , K} and parameters
(cid:16)

θ(J)
M , θ(J)
. In a birth, we ﬁrst uniformly sample a new cluster centre C ∗ together with
the index j∗ at which to insert it in the set C(J); the probabilities are P (cid:0)C ∗ = k | C(J)(cid:1) =

(cid:17)

D

(K − J)−1 (k ∈ {1, . . . , K} \ C(J)) and P(j∗ | C(J)) = (J + 1)−1 (j∗ = 1, . . . , J + 1). For

the new set of cluster centres, C∗ = (C1, . . . , C ∗

j∗, . . . , CJ+1), we then derive the cluster

labels Z∗ according to (18).

To complete the proposal, we sample the parameters ((cid:15)∗, σ∗, ξ∗) of the new cluster. The

mean of each proposal distribution is set to the current average value of that parameter

across the sites allocated to the new cluster, while the variance of the proposal is set to

the one of the corresponding prior. Let C∗ = {k : Z ∗

k = j∗} denote the sites allocated to

33

the new cluster. The proposal ξ∗ is sampled from a normal distribution with

ξ∗ | (cid:0)ξ(J), Z, Z∗(cid:1) ∼ Normal

The proposal varies (cid:15)∗ with respect to the current number J of clusters. If J > 1, (cid:15)∗

is sampled with

In case J = 1, the model for Pk,k(cid:48) (k, k(cid:48) = 1, . . . , K) is fully described by the parameters

γ1 and β.

If a second cluster is proposed, we have to sample two proposals to derive

(γ0, γ1, γ2), and in order to satisfy the satisfy the dimension matching condition (Green,

1995). We sample (cid:15)∗

1 and (cid:15)∗

2 independently from an Exponential(θ(cid:15)) and deﬁne γ∗

0 as

0 = γ1 exp ((cid:15)∗

2 = γ1 exp ((cid:15)∗

We compute the acceptance probability as given in Green (1995). The determinant

of the Jacobian is equal to 1, unless J = 1, since the deﬁned mapping is the identity

function. For J = 1, the determinant of the Jacobian is exp((cid:15)∗

1). For the reverse move,

death, we select one of the existing cluster centreswith equal probability. The probability

the accept the new cluster is thus

Remaining moves

In case of a shift move, we ﬁrst select one of the current cluster centres with equal

probability and propose to reallocate it to one of the adjacent sites which is not currently

a cluster centre. Let j∗ be the index of the sampled cluster centre. We ﬁrst derive the

set N of potential sites and then select one with equal probability as the new cluster

centre C ∗. This reallocation of a cluster centre usually changes the spatial clusters and

we thus derive the set of updated cluster labels Z∗ via (18). To calculate the acceptance

probability, we also require the set N ∗ of sites adjacent to C ∗ which are not cluster centres;

this set includes the current cluster centre Cj∗. Since θ(J)

M and θ(J)

D do not change, the

prior densities cancel and the acceptance probability is

We speciﬁed three moves to update θ∗

D. Since the parameters for cluster j and

j(cid:48), j (cid:54)= j(cid:48), are independent given Z, each cluster parameter is updated separately via an

independence sampler; the proposal distribution is equal to the prior in this case and the

acceptance probability is thus equal to the likelihood ratio. The last move updates the

hyperparameters by drawing from the full conditional distributions using Gibbs sampling.
