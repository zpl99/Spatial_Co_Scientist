Clustering analysis has received considerable attention in spatial data mining for several years. With the rapid development of the geospatial 
information  technologies,  the  size  of  spatial  information  data  is  growing  exponentially  which  makes  clustering  massive  spatial  data  a 
challenging task. In order to improve the efficiency of spatial clustering  for large scale data,  many researchers proposed several efficient 
clustering algorithms in parallel. In this paper, a new K-Medoids++ spatial clustering algorithm based on MapReduce for clustering massive 
spatial  data  is  proposed.  The  initialization  algorithm  to  decrease  the  number  of  iterations  is  combined  with  the  MapReduce  framework. 
Comparative  Experiments  conducted  over  different  dataset  and  different  number  of  nodes  indicate  that  the  proposed  K-Medoids  spatial 
clustering algorithm provides better efficiency than traditional K-Medoids and scales well while processing massive spatial data on commodity 
hardware.

1.   Introduction 

Clustering is one of the common problems in data mining and computational geometry. It enables to group a set of 
multidimensional points into different classes so that different multidimensional points with inter-point similarity and intra-
point difference can be classify into the same cluster 1. In other words, clustering is to find natural clusters in the data set 
which  has  been  widely  used  in  the  areas  such  as  city  planning,  remote  sensing  and  geographic  information  science 
(GIScience) 2. Spatial clustering in this work is to classify the two dimensional spatial points in the area of GIScience.   

However, traditional K-Means clustering algorithm proposed by Refs. 3-4 in different research areas independently 
is sensitive to outers. As a result, the K-Medoids clustering algorithm is proposed which is more robust than K-Means, 
where the medoids are used to replace the mean of the multidimensional points in the same class. The replacement rule of 
the medoid of a specific cluster is based on the cost and the non-medoid with the less cost will replace the current medoid 
which makes K-Medoid less sensitive to noises compared with the K-Means clustering 5.   

Spatial clustering algorithms is efficient while classifying the small size spatial data set but the efficiency will drop 
sharply as the data volume increasing. As for K-Medoids clustering algorithm, the performance is good when processing 
small size data set but the performance will decrease when the scale of the spatial data is increased. However, the size of 
the spatial data processed by many spatial analysis applications will frequently surpass the peta-scale threshold with the 
rapid development of geospatial information technique and the computational requirements will increase enormously  6. 
Improving the spatial clustering algorithm itself and optimizing the proceeding of execution are commonly believed to be 
a valid solution to increase the efficiency while clustering massive spatial data. The K-Medoids clustering algorithm is 
time consuming while processing massive two dimensional spatial points though it is robust against outers. As a result, the 
more efficient K-Medoids spatial clustering algorithm should be proposed and this paper pays attention on this issue. 

MapReduce is a parallel programming architecture for processing massive dataset. Google and Apache Hadoop both 
provide MapReduce framework with dynamic support and fault tolerance 7. In this work, the K-Medoids spatial clustering 
algorithm is adapted to MapReduce framework so that the job of clustering massive spatial data can be implemented on 
Hadoop  platform.  What’s  more,  the  initialization  algorithm  proposed  in  Ref.  8  to  decrease  the  number  of  iterations  is 
combined with the MapReduce framework and the proposed algorithm is termed K-Mediods++. By designing the proper 

1 

 
 
 
 
Map  and  Reduce  procedure,  the  proposed  K-Medoids++  can  be  executed  effectively  on  multi-node  cluster.  The 
experiments on Hadoop and HBase conducted over different dataset and different number of nodes demonstrate that the 
proposed K-Medoids spatial clustering algorithm can provide better efficiency while processing massive spatial data on 
commodity hardware than traditional K-Medoids and scales well. 

The  remaining  parts  of  this  paper  are  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  MapReduce,  Hadoop,  HBase  and  the 
traditional K-Medoids algorithm are briefly introduced. Section 3 presents the basic MapReduce process and the proposed 
K-Medoids spatial clustering algorithm. Section 4 shows the experiments with respect to efficiency and speedup. In Section 
5, some conclusions are given. 

2.   Preliminaries 

In this section, the core concepts about MapReduce, Hadoop, HBase and K-Mediods algorithm is given. 

2.1.   MapReduce 

MapReduce  is  a  distributed  programming  model  and  an  efficient  scheduling  model  for  task  resource  allocation 
originally from functional programming language. The main ideology of this model is using map and reduce functions to 
spilt  and  combine  the  data.  A  MapReduce  program  is  composed  of  a  Map  function  which  is  designed  for  sorting  and 
filtering the input data and a Reduce function which is designed for summing up the data. The MapReduce framework is 
designed for managing the distributed servers and running massive computing jobs in parallel. It manages all data transfers 
between  different  tasks  of  the  framework  with  redundancy  and  high  fault  tolerance.  The  basic  programming  model  of 
MapReduce architecture is shown in Fig. 1. 

Fig. 1.    Basic programming model of MapReduce 

MapReduce frameworks have the ability of processing large distributed tasks in parallel environment such as cloud 
computing infrastructures. It supports the scientific researches as well as the commercial applications by building large 
clusters to support data-intensive calculations. With the introducing of MapReduce programming model, designing the 
map function which processes a <key, value> pair to generate a <key, value> pair and the reduce function which takes all 
combined <key, value> pairs together to generate a set of outputs is of vital importance to process the massive data 9. 

2.2.   Hadoop and HBase 

Hadoop  is  a  Java-based  implementation  of  MapReduce  programming  framework  by  Apache  for  massive  data 
distributed processing on cloud computing clusters. The basic feature of Hadoop is that it can automatically handle the 
hardware failure so that the cloud computing clusters can be built on commodity hardware.    Hadoop consists of operation 
level component, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce component. HDFS is used for data storage and 
distributing the data into different blocks in different clusters. HDFS ensures the high fault tolerance by replicating the data 
blocks into different nodes and the data locality information in HDFS is used for the communication between the nodes. 

A typical instance of Hadoop includes a master node and several slave nodes. The master node consists of a JobTracker, 
TaskTracker, NameNode, and DataNode. The JobTracker which is the service for assigning the jobs to the nodes with the 
target data and the TaskTracker which is a node in the cluster that accepts jobs from a JobTracker are the components of 
the MapReduce Engine. A slave node mostly acts as a TaskTracker and DataNode. NameNode is the control node and 
DataNode is the work node of HDFS. The structure of Hadoop cluster is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2.    Multi-node cluster 

HBase is an additional software package of Hadoop and is built on top of HDFS. It is a part of Apache Hadoop project 
providing the functions like BigTable with the feature of fault tolerance. The data is stored in a number of rows with unique 
keys in HBase but each row can store any number of columns. For example, one row can have one column while another 
row can have thousands of columns. The data in HBase is stored in distributed nodes in the cluster. The basic storage unit 
is HStore with each family stored in it. For example, column A is stored in the first HStore, column B is stored in the 
second HStore, column C and column D are stored in the last HStore.    It shows the efficiency of retrieving a column 
rather than a row in HBase. HMaster is used to request the HStore to retrieve a column 10. 

2.3.   K-Medoids 

The K-Means clustering has become one of the popular clustering algorithm because of its excellent performance. 
However,  it  is  easily  influenced by  the outliers.  In order to  improve  the  robustness of the  clustering algorithm,  the K-
Medoid algorithm is proposed by using the medoids which are the elements in the date set as the center of the clusters. It 
attempts to minimize the cost between non-medoids of the cluster and the medoid of the cluster. PAM (Partitioning Around 
Medoids),  the  earliest  K-Medoids  algorithm,  was  proposed  by  Kaufman  and  Rousseeuw  11  which  can  be  described  as 
follow. (1) Select    𝑘  points in the data set arbitrarily as the initial medoids. (2) Classify each non-medoid point to the 
nearest medoid according to the Euclidean distance. (3) Choose the new medoid with the least cost for each cluster. (4) 
Continue Step (2) until the total cost remain the same. The total cost can be formulated as follows. 

|𝑝𝑚 − 𝑜𝑛|2

𝑘
𝐸 = ∑
𝑛=1

∑

𝑝𝑚∈𝐶𝑛

                                           (1)   
where  𝐶𝑛    and  𝑜𝑛  are the  𝑛th cluster and the medoid of this cluster, separately.  𝑝𝑚  is the point in the  𝑛th cluster. 
|𝑝𝑚 − 𝑜𝑛|2  is the Euclidean distance between one of the non-medoid and the medoid in the same cluster. There are for 
cases for the replacement between the non-medoid  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  and the medoid  O𝑖  and  O𝑗. Case 1: p is classified to medoid 
O𝑖. If the closest medoid is another  O𝑗(𝑖 ≠ 𝑗)  after  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  replaced  O𝑖, then classify p to  O𝑗. Case 2: p is classified to 
medoid  O𝑖 .  If  the  closest  medoid  is  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡   after  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡   replaced  O𝑖 ,  then  classify  p  to  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 .  Case  3:  p  is 
attached to medoid  O𝑗. If the closest medoid is  O𝑗  after  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  replaced  O𝑖, then the label of p remain the same. Case 
12. 
4: p is attached to medoid  O𝑗. If the closest medoid is  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  after  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  replaced O𝑖, then classify p to  O𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡
The K-Medoid algorithm clustering algorithm works effectively while clustering low dimensional data sets with small 
size, but is not that efficient for massive data sets because of its complexity 13. As a result, the paralleled K-Medoids++ 
algorithm is proposed with the effective initialize algorithm. 

3.   Methodology 

3.1.   Initialization algorithm of K-Medoids++ 

The K-Medoids algorithm finds cluster medoids by minimizing the intra-class discrepancy. However, the k-Mediods 

algorithm has the following theoretical drawbacks.

MasterSlaveTask trackerJobtrackerNamenodeDatanodeDatanodeTask trackerMulti-node clusterMapReduce layerHDFSlayer 
 
 
First, the number of medoids should be given in advance. However, the number of medoids is hard to determine in 

many cases. Second, the initial medoids should be selected manually which will increase the number of iterations. 

The proposed k-Mediods++ algorithm addresses the second concern by using the initialization algorithm proposed in 

Ref. 8 to decrease the number of iterations. The explicit algorithm is as follows. 

(1) The initial medoid is chosen randomly among all of the spatial points. 
(2) For each spatial point  𝑝, compute the distance between  𝑝  and the nearest medoids which is termed as  D(𝑝)  and 

sum all the distances to 𝑆  .   

(3)  The  next  medoid  is  determined  by  using  weighted  probability  distribution.  Specifically,  a  random  number  𝑅 

between zero and the summed distance  𝑆  is chosen and the corresponding spatial point is the next medoid. 

(4) Step (2) and Step (3) are repeated until  𝑘  medoids have been chosen. 

3.2.   Basic MapReduce data processing Flow 

The basic MapReduce algorithm for K-Medoids++ spatial clustering can be summarized to three steps as follows 13, 

14.   

(1) Generating  𝑘  points as initial  𝑘  medoids using the initialization algorithm. 
(2) The Map procedure on Hadoop. 
Map: (key, value) -> list (key, value).   
The keys of the output are identifiers of clusters and the values of the output are the coordinates of spatial points. 
(3) The Reduce procedure on Hadoop. 
Reduce: (key, list(value)) -> list (key, value)   
The keys of the input and the output are identifiers of clusters, and the values of the input are the coordinates of spatial 

points. The values of the output are coordinates of the new medoids.   

The three steps can be simplified as follows. 
(1) The initial medoids are generated. 
(2) Applying K-Medoids in MapReduce architecture.   

3.3.   Parallel algorithm implement 

The implement of the parallel algorithm needs the MapReduce job. The map function acts as the operation of assigning 

each spatial points to the closest medoid while the reduce function acts as the operation of generating the new medoid.   

The input spatial data is stored on HBase as a sequence file of coordinates. The key of map function is the row number 
in  the  HBase dataset  and  the  value  is  a  string of  the  corresponding  coordinate.  The  spatial points are  split and  sent  to 
mappers. As a result, the distance between the medoid and the non-medoid is computed in parallel. All the initial medoids 
are  stored  in  the  file  of  medoids  as  the  input  of  the  map  function.  The  output  is  the  (key,  value)  pair  containing  the 
information of the cluster ID and the coordinate. The pseudocode of Map function is shown in Table 1.

Algorithm 1. Map(ImmutableByteWritable row, Result value, Context CText)

Output: < Out-Key , Out-Value> pair. Out-Key is the cluster ID. Out-Value is the coordinate of this row. 
1. Get the coordinate from values. 
Point point=GetCoordinateFromText(Pointlist.next()); 
2. Initialize the minimum of the distance as the max value of double type. 
MinOfDistance = Double.MAX VALUE; 
3. Classify the available points

Medoid=GetMedoidFromClusterID(Medoids,i); 
Distance = CalculateDistance(Medoid,point); 
If(Distance < MinOfDistance) 
{ MinOfDistance = Distance; Out-Key =(Text)i; } 
} 
4. Output the cluster ID and the coordinate of the point. 
CText.write(Out-Key, values); 
5. Construct value’ as a string comprise of the values of different dimensions;

7. End 

The input of the reduce function is the output list of (key, value) pairs of the map function. The (key, value) pairs with 
the same key value are combined in the list. The costs of the medoid and the candidate medoids are calculated and the 
candidate medoids with the least cost is chosen as the new medoid for the next iteration. The output is the (key, value) pair 
containing the information of the cluster ID and the coordinate of the new medoid. The pseudocode of Reduce function is 
shown in Table 2.

Algorithm 2. Reduce (Text Key, Iterable<Text> Pointlist, Context CText) 
Input: Key is the cluster ID. Pointlist is the list of the coordinates assigned to this cluster. CText is for transferring the data. 
Output: < Out-Key , Out-Value> pair. Out-Key is the same cluster ID with Key. Out-Value is the new medoid. 
1. Get the cluster ID from the input key. 
Cluster_ID= GetClusterID(Key); 
2. Load the file of the mediods and calculate the cost of the medoid of the specific cluster. 
Medoids=LoadMedoids(FILE); 
Medoid=GetMedoidFromClusterID(Medoids,Cluster_ID); 
MinCost= CalculateCost(Mediod); 
3. Calculate the cost of the candidate medoids and choose the corresponding cluster ID. 
i=0; 
while(Pointlist.hasNext()){ 
Point point=GetCoordinateFromText(Pointlist.next()); 
Cost=CalculateCost(point); i++ 
If(MinCost < Cost) 
{ MinCost = Cost; Out-Value=(Text)point;}} 
4. Output the cluster ID and the coordinate of the new medoid. 
CText.write((Text)Cluster_ID, Out-Value); 
5. Update the file of the mediods. 
        writefile((Text)Cluster_ID, Out-Value); 

(3) Compare the previous file of the mediods with the updating file of the mediods. If the medoids retain the same, 

then the program output the clustering result. Otherwise, go back to another iteration with the new file of medoids. 

4.   Experiment

4.2.   Experimental result 

In this section, the performance of the proposed spatial clustering algorithm is evaluated in terms of speedup and 
efficiency on the cluster mentioned above. The speedup is to evaluate the expansibility of the proposed algorithm which 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
indicates the ability of processing the same size of dataset as the hardware resources increasing. To evaluate the speed up, 
the dataset remained the same and the number of nodes increased. The linear speedup is the ideal speed up of the parallel 
algorithm. For example, a parallel system with n times the number of nodes yields a speedup of n. However, linear speedup 
is hard to realize because the cost of communication between computer nodes is increasing as the number of nodes growing. 
Six groups of cluster is designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and each group of cluster has 
certain number of cloud computing node. The specific composition of each group of cluster is shown in Table 4. Three 
spatial data sets with data sizes and numbers of spatial points are shown in Table 5.

5.   Conclusions 

Spatial clustering is of vital significance in geospatial data mining. The enlarging geospatial information of very large 
size makes spatial clustering a challenging task though many spatial clustering algorithms have been proposed in several 
decades.  The  techniques  of  parallel  cloud  computing  are  no  doubt  the  suitable  choices.  In  this  paper,  an  efficient  K-
Medoids++ spatial clustering algorithm with the initial algorithm is proposed based on MapReduce framework which has 
been commonly embraced by academia and industry. 

There are two main aspects of the improvement of the proposed K-Medoids++ spatial clustering algorithm. Firstly, 
the  effective  initial  medoids  searching  algorithm  is  integrated  into  K-Medoids++  spatial  clustering  to  find  the  suitable 
medoids as to decrease the number of iterations. Secondly, the K-Medoids++ spatial clustering algorithm is paralleled in 
MapReduce framework. 21 experiments are designed and the speedups of each group are used to evaluate the performances 
of the proposed algorithm. The experiment results show that the proposed K-Medoids++ spatial clustering algorithm can 
deal with massive spatial data effectively and scales well on commodity hardware.
