ABSTRACT

Aims. Some theoretical scenarios suggest the formation of brown dwarfs as ejected stellar embryos in star-forming clusters. Such
a formation mechanism can result in diﬀerent spatial distributions of stars and substellar objects. We aim to investigate the spatial
structure of stellar and substellar objects in two well sampled and nearby embedded clusters, namely IC348 and the Orion Trapezium
Cluster (OTC) to test this hypothesis.
Methods. Deep near-infrared K-band data complete enough to sample the substellar population in IC348 and OTC are obtained from
the literature. The spatial distribution of the K-band point sources is analysed using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method. The
Q parameter and the spanning trees are evaluated for stellar and substellar objects as a function of cluster core radius Rc.
Results. The stellar population in both IC348 and OTC display a clustered distribution whereas the substellar population is distributed
homogeneously in space within twice the cluster core radius. Although the substellar objects do not appear to be bound by the cluster
potential well, they are still within the limits of the cluster and not signiﬁcantly displaced from their birth sites.
Conclusions. The spatially homogeneous distribution of substellar objects is best explained by assuming higher initial velocities,
distributed in a random manner and going through multiple interactions. The overall spatial coincidence of these objects with the
cluster locations can be understood if these objects are nevertheless travelling slowly enough so as to feel the gravitational inﬂuence
of the cluster. The observations support the scenario of formation of substellar objects as “ejected stellar embryos”. Higher ejection
velocities are necessary but net spatial displacements may not be necessary to explain the observational data.

1. Introduction

Observations of embedded clusters display structure and mass
segregation generally thought to reﬂect the structure of molec-
ular clouds from which they were born and the gravitational
potential of the cluster (Lada & Lada 2003). Massive stars are
found to be located at the centers of the clusters and the ra-
dial distribution of cluster members roughly follow King models
or power law variations (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998). These
ﬁndings are generally based on observations sampling the stel-
lar content of the clusters. With the advent of sensitive infrared
detectors, the substellar content has been eﬀectively unveiled
allowing studies of brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects.
In the rest of this paper we shall refer to Brown Dwarfs and
free-ﬂoating planetary mass objects as BDs without distinction.
The BDs are known to be particularly luminous in their early
stages owing to which hundreds of such objects are detected in
near-infrared surveys of embedded clusters (Muench et al. 2003;
Lucas et al. 2005).

The formation of substellar objects can be explained through
at least ﬁve alternative mechanisms (Whitworth et al. 2007).
One of the important mechanisms, the so-called “ejected em-
bryos” scenario, advocates formation of BDs as a result of
premature ejection of protostellar embryos from multiple sys-
tems. This “ejection scenario” attributes higher velocity dis-
persion and spatial spread to BDs in comparision to stel-
lar objects (Reipurth & Clarke 2001; Kroupa & Bouvier 2003).
Observations of the radial velocities of BDs and stars in Taurus
and Chameleon star forming regions indicate that there is no

signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the velocity dispersion between stars
and brown dwarfs (Luhman et al. 2007). Young stars and BDs
are also thought to be homogeneously mixed in the Trapezium
cluster and Taurus molecular cloud. Much of these results are
obtained by studying a few objects in localized regions of the
cluster or in a region like Taurus where star formation occurs
in relative isolation. In a deep near-infrared study of the IC348
cluster, Muench et al. (2003) analysed the radial distribution of
point sources which indicated a relatively homogeneous distri-
bution of BDs in space compared to the stellar population that is
bound to the cluster potential.

The structure analysis of embedded clusters has gained im-
portance in recent years, since numerical simulations of the star
formation process on the scales of molecular clouds are avail-
able (e.g. Bate et al. 2003), which can be tested against obser-
vational results. Further, to facilitate the structure analysis of
observed data, quantitative methods of statistical analysis have
also been developed. The nearest neighbour method and the min-
imum spanning tree (MST) method (Cartwright & Whitworth
2004) are two statistical methods that can be applied on obser-
vational data to analyse and quantify the physical parameters
of clusters based on structure analysis. The structures of some
star forming clusters have been analysed using the MST method
(Cartwright & Whitworth 2004; Schmeja & Klessen 2006).

IC348 and the Orion Trapezium cluster (hereafter OTC) are
two nearby well-studied star forming regions for which deep
near-infrared data are available. The OTC in particular has been
the target of several deep surveys that aimed to unveil the sam-
ple of BDs down to planetary mass objects. In both, IC348 and

OTC, the BD population is well sampled. These are also richly
populated clusters where a statistically signiﬁcant sample of sub-
stellar objects are catalogued. In this letter we will analyse the
structure of both IC348 and OTC to study the variations for the
stellar and BD populations.

2. Data sets and analysis methods

Near-infrared point source catalogs for the OTC were obtained
from the Muench et al. (2002) and Lucas et al. (2005) studies
via the on-line VizieR database. The Muench et al. (2002) data
cover a region centered on the Trapezium cluster to a 10σ de-
tection limit of K = 18.1 mag and include all the sources found
by Hillenbrand & Carpenter (2000). The Lucas et al. (2005) data
obtained through FLAMINGOS on GEMINI south telescope
cover a region adjacent to the boundary of the Trapezium cluster
which suﬀers from relatively little contamination from the K-
band nebulosity. We combined both the catalogs taking care of
overlaps that resulted in a coverage of ∼ 0.◦1 × 0.◦1. In the over-
lapping regions between the two surveys we chose to use the
magnitudes from Muench et al. (2002). Data for the IC348 re-
gion were obtained from the FLAMINGOS survey described by
Muench et al. (2003). The data cover an ∼21′×21′ area centered
on the IC348 cluster to a depth of K∼17 mag.

Based on comparisons to pre-main sequence evolution-
ary tracks (Lucas et al. 2005) and luminosity function mod-
elling (Muench et al. 2002), in the OTC sources brighter than
K=14 mag can be considered stars and sources with K>14 can
be considered BDs. Similarly, in IC348, sources fainter than
K=15 mag should be complete to 0.04M⊙ brown dwarfs seen
through an extinction of Av ∼7. These estimations take into ac-
count the eﬀects of extinction and nebulosity, hence they repre-
sent a sample not contaminated by such eﬀects. We will use this
classiﬁcation in the following analysis to distinguish stars and
BDs.

Control ﬁeld data were obtained from the 2MASS point
source catalog. The control ﬁelds were selected by looking at
large area (5◦) IRAS 100 µm maps and choosing a region of very
low emission. Point sources within a circle of radius 15′ were
extracted with the criteria of photometric quality ﬂags better than
“D” and without confusion (ccﬂag=0). The Orion control ﬁeld
is centered at 05h24m −07◦20′. In the case of IC348, the oﬀ-
cloud control ﬁeld is located at 03h36m +35◦00′; another ﬁeld
on the Perseus molecular cloud centered at 03h39m +31◦20′ was
also examined. Although the 2MASS survey 100% complete-
ness limit is at K=14 mag, several reliable detections of K=15-
17 mag are also found in the point source catalog at a lower σ
level.

We use the positions and magnitudes to analyse the spatial
distribution of the objects by means of a minimum spanning tree,
the unique set of straight lines (“edges”) connecting a given set
of points without closed loops, such that the sum of the edge
lengths is a minimum (e.g Gower & Ross 1969). We derive the
mean edge length ℓMST as well as the parameter Q = ¯ℓMST/ ¯s by
combining the normalised mean edge length and the normalised
correlation length ¯s as described in Cartwright & Whitworth
(2004) and Schmeja & Klessen (2006). The Q parameter quan-
tiﬁes the cluster structure and distinguishes between a centrally
condensated cluster (Q > 0.8) and a cluster showing fractal sub-
structure (Q < 0.8), while ℓMST can be seen as the mean distance
between two neighbouring objects. We construct the MST using
the algorithm of Prim (1957) implemented in an IDL routine.

3. Results

The MST method was applied on the photometric data to analyse
the following:

a) The variation of the Q parameter as a function of source
magnitude (therefore source mass) selected to construct the tree.
At every magnitude (intervals of 0.2 mag), Q was evaluated by
considering all sources brighter than the given magnitude. This
variation was studied for the cluster ﬁeld and the control ﬁelds.
b) The structure of the minimum spanning tree for stars and
BDs separately. The resultant mean edge lengths ℓMST along
with their standard deviation and minimum and maximum val-
ues were obtained for each tree. Projected separations less than
150 AU (indicating source binarity) are neglected in computing
ℓMST to remove their eﬀect on the overall distribution. Further,
the edge lenghts were examined inside and outside a radius that
deﬁne the cluster core boundaries.

In Figures 1 and 2 we show these results for IC348 and OTC.
In both ﬁgures, panel a) shows the variation of Q with magni-
tude, while panels b) and c) show the tree structure for stellar
and substellar sources respectively. The dotted circles represent
boundary limits of the cluster as deﬁned by radial proﬁle mod-
elling. The ℓMST values for each zone enclosed by the bound-
aries, along with the statistics are listed in Table 1.

It can be seen from Figs. 1a and 2a that the Q values peak
at brighter magnitudes and show a turn-over at K=14 mag for
IC348 and K=11 mag for OTC decreasing smoothly towards
fainter magnitudes. In comparision, the data from the control
ﬁelds do not show signiﬁcant variations of the Q paramater with
magnitude. They yield values in the range of Q ≈ 0.72, the
value expected for a random distribution. The peak Q values
for IC348 and OTC are 0.9 and 0.94, respectively, indicating
centrally condensed conﬁgurations. Following the ﬁndings of
Cartwright & Whitworth (2004) (condensation for Q > 0.8, frac-
tral substructure for Q < 0.8), these results imply that in IC348
sources fainter than K=15.5 mag (the point where Q touches
0.8 in Fig. 1a) are distributed in space with a fractal structure
while brigther sources are more centrally condensed. The same
intrepretation in OTC suggests a general central condensation
that is only weak for the fainter sources.

The structure of the MST in Figs. 1b and 2b display clusters
at the center of the ﬁeld while Figs. 1c and 2c display a ho-
mogeneous distribution of sources. The clustering can be seen
as branches of smaller edge lengths at the center spreading into
branches of longer edge lengths away from the center. It can
also be noted that the clusters in Figs. 1b and 2b coincide well
with the B star in IC348 and with the Trapezium stars in the
OTC cluster, shown with ﬁlled star symbols. The fainter sources
do not show detectable variations in the tree structure across
the ﬁeld. These results are demonstrated more quantitatively in
Table 1. The linear lengths in Table 1 are derived from the an-
gular lengths by assuming a distance of 315 pc and 500 pc to
IC348 and OTC, respectively. The edge lengths for stars and
BDs are listed individually for each cluster inside and outside
the cluster full-width half maximum boundaries (also referred
as cluster core radius Rc). In the IC348 cluster, the boundaries
of 5′and 10′ represent the cluster core radius Rc and the limit
at which the radial proﬁle merges with the background. These
values are adopted from Muench et al. (2002) where the radial
distribution of sources is modelled. Similarly, a boundary of
Rc=1.′2 is assumed for OTC based on the King Model ﬁts from
Hillenbrand & Hartmann (1998). In IC348, the ℓMST values for
stars within Rc=5′and outside vary by a factor of 1.9, whereas
for substellar objects (denoted as BDs) they show similar val-

ues. In the case of OTC the ℓMST values of stars change by a
factor of 2.12 and those of BDs by 1.4 within and outside the
assumed cluster core radius of Rc = 1.′2.

The above results are free from contamination due to binarity
(as we excluded tree branches smaller than 150 AU) but include
small N clusters. A total of 19 sources were excluded in the OTC
sample that imitated binary lengths. The comparisions between
inside and outside the cluster radius Rc show that the stars are
centrally concentrated in both IC348 and OTC clusters whereas
the BDs are distributed uniformly. In IC348, the BDs are clearly
homogeneously distributed within the radius of 10′ reproducing
the results of Muench et al. (2003). The MST variation of BDs in
OTC may indicate weak concentration at the center, although the
region examined here encompasses only the Trapezium cluster
which is the central part of the much larger Orion Nebula Cluster
(Hillenbrand 1997). Therefore, these variations show, that un-
like stars, the BDs are not limited by the cluster potential in both

4. Discussion

The results of the analysis presented in the previous section has
two signiﬁcant parts:

a) The BDs are spread uniformly in space and not limited
by the cluster potential well whereas stars are bound by a well
described cluster potential. This can be explained if BDs in the
cluster are seen as an N particle system with higher initial ve-
locities than the stars in random directions produced by mul-
tiple interactions at early times. The net result will be a rela-
tively uniform distribution of space positions and velocities in-
stead of being constrained by the gradient of the cluster potential
well. Such a scenario of multiple objects and chaotic interactions
is well described by the numerical simulations such as that of
Bate et al. (2003). However, this process is relevant during the
early evolution of the cluster (within 105 yrs) thus setting up the
“initial” conditions for BDs. Higher initial velocities are nec-
essary to overcome the cluster potential gradient and produce
the homogeneous distribution of spatial locations. The natural
eﬀect of lower mass objects acquiring higher recoil velocities
in comparision to higher mass objects (Reipurth & Clarke 2001;
Kroupa & Bouvier 2003) can result in BDs having the necessary
ejection velocities. This is in accordance with the predictions
of Kroupa & Bouvier (2003) who compute higher dispersion in
ejection velocities of 2-3 km s−1 for BDs.

b) The BDs appear slightly more centrally concentrated in
the 1 Myr old OTC than in the 3 Myr old IC348 cluster. While
the BDs show a homogeneous distribution in space, they are still
limited to the physical boundaries of the cluster or only slightly
spread out. This is evident from the signiﬁcant number of BDs in
comparison to stars in both clusters (see last column of Table 1).
It implies that the BDs have not traversed in space signiﬁcantly
away from the regions where they were born. The more uniform
distribution in the 3 Myr old IC348 cluster with respect to the
1 Myr old OTC imply that, with time, the BDs may indeed be
moving away from the cluster center, but the net displacement
is not signiﬁcant. Assuming higher initial velocities for BDs,
the cluster potential that operates on the larger scale, will re-
duce their overall displacement away from the cluster center.
Goodwin et al. (2005) examine the spatial distribution of BDs
produced by the decay of small N stellar systems as expected
from the embryo ejection scenario and show that signiﬁcant spa-
tial spread of BDs with respect to stars may occur only after 5
Myr. Their predictions are consistent with the results of IC348
and OTC.

The above results are therefore clear signatures of the sce-
nario of “ejected stellar embryos” (Reipurth & Clarke 2001;
Kroupa & Bouvier 2003) as an important mechanism for the for-
mation of brown dwarfs and free-ﬂoating planetary mass objects.
Several studies have been made to investigate the diﬀer-
ences in spatial distribution of stars and BDs in star forming
regions. In the Chamaeleon I cloud, the distribution of BDs
and low mass stars was found to be similar (L´opez Mart´ı et al.
2004) and in the Lupus cloud BDs were found close to their
birth sites (L´opez Mart´ı et al. 2005). In the Taurus molecular
cloud, Brice˜no et al. (2002) examined the distributions of near-
est neighbours to objects with spectral indices ≤M6 and >M6
and concluded that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
spatial distribution of stars and BDs. Examining a smaller group
of T-Tauri stars Mart´ın et al. (2001) hinted at an anticorrelation
between density of stars and BDs in Taurus. Luhman (2006) ex-
amined an area of 225 deg2 covering almost the entire Taurus
Molecular Cloud and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the spa-
tial distributions of BDs and stars.

The above studies were made because according to the
“ejected embryos” scenario, BDs may be expected to be
signiﬁcantly displaced from their birth locations. For exam-
ple,assuming a 1D dispersion velocity of 1 km s−1they should
have moved ∼1 pc away (corresponding to 7′≈6×Rc) from the
cluster in 1Myr old OTC or about 3 pc away (corresponding to
35′≈7×Rc) in the IC348 cluster( if they do not experience any
retarding force from the cluster potential). However, as evident
from the data presented here, the BDs are indeed located within a
region ∼ 2×Rc in both the clusters. Whether there is a signiﬁcant
concentration of BDs much farther away from the cluster cores
in IC348 and OTC is an issue that needs investigation and is be-
yond the scope of the data analysed here. However, following
the example of Taurus, where Luhman (2006) examined the en-
tire molecular cloud, signiﬁcant populations of BDs away from
the dense cores may not be expected.

The major diﬀerence between previous studies and this work
is the advantage of large number statistics and space densities of
point sources found in IC348 and OTC. This number statistics
has made it possible to eﬀectively apply the MST technique to
analyse the spatial distribution. In the absence of the MST anal-
ysis, IC348 and OTC would imitate the results of Taurus, ChaI
or Lupus described above. Indeed in Fig. 2 of Luhman (2006) it
can be seen that the BDs are sparsely populated while stars are
relatively clustered. MST analysis for Taurus may also show the
kind of variations found here, but the IC348 and OTC are clearly
better data sets for eﬀective application of the MST method
which is “statistical” in nature. In conclusion, we have shown
that the near-infrared observations of the IC348 and OTC em-
bedded clusters are in accordance with the “ejected stellar em-
bryos” scenario for the formation of substellar objects. Higher
ejection velocities for substellar objects are essential but their
spatial displacements from the birth sites may not be necessary
to explain the observed data.
