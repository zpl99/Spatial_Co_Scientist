Abstract 

One of the most vital activities to reduce energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is clustering. In clustering, one node 
from a group of nodes is selected to be a cluster head, which handles majority of the computation and processing for the nodes in 
the cluster. This paper proposes an algorithm for fuzzy based dynamic cluster head selection on cloud in wireless sensor networks. 
The proposed algorithm calculates a Potential value for each node and selects cluster heads with  high potential. The proposed 
algorithm  minimizes cluster overlapping by spatial distribution of cluster heads and discards malicious nodes i.e. never allows 
malicious nodes to be cluster heads.

1. Introduction 

Owing to the rampant development of communication, computation and hardware technology in the past decade, 
Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSNs)  have  emerged  in  the  fields  of  agriculture,  homeland  security,  navy,  weather 
forecasting etc. [1]. WSNs consist of spatially distributed sensor nodes which communicate wirelessly, have limited 
energy  and  computation  power.  A  huge  amount  of  research  on  WSNs  is  directed  towards  increasing  the  network 
lifetime of WSNs by making them energy efficient. One of the key activities to increase network lifetime in WSNs is 
clustering. 

Clustering in WSNs is the process of dividing the WSN into smaller groups, aimed to increase network lifetime. 
Each group/cluster consists of a cluster head/ sink node. The cluster head is responsible for majority of the processing 
and  computation  of  the  cluster.  Clustering  helps  in  increasing  the  energy  efficiency  of  WSNs  by  minimizing  the 
number of communications in the network [2]. In most clustering techniques a cluster head is selected solely on the 
basis of its energy level. However, there are a few additional essential factors which make a node an ideal candidate 
to be a cluster head, such as: 

ÔÇ∑  Reachability to nearby nodes 
ÔÇ∑  Quality of connection to base station 
ÔÇ∑  Node reliability [3] 

Clustering techniques such as CHUFL[4] and CHEF[5] make use of 2 of these additional factors in selecting a 
cluster head using fuzzy logic within the WSN. These techniques, through their soft computations, add substantial

processing overhead on the WSN. The integration of cloud and WSNs [6] offers the computational power needed. 
The fuzzy based computation in the proposed algorithm runs on the cloud, thereby eliminating the added processing 
overhead. The proposed algorithm also caters to all 3 additional factors. 

2. Related Work 

In [1] paper, detailed introduction to wireless sensor networks and their properties has been presented. In [2] paper, 
distance based Cluster head selection algorithm has been proposed for improving the sensor network life time. In [3] 
paper, effects of Blackhole attack are measured on the network parameters are presented along with the technique for 
the detection and prevention of Blackhole attack in WSN. In [4] paper, Cluster Head selection protocol using Fuzzy 
Logic  (CHUFL)  has  been  presented.  Cluster  Head  Election  mechanism  using  Fuzzy  Logic  protocol  (CHEF)  is 
discussed in [5]. In [6] paper, exponential trust based mechanism has been presented to detect malicious nodes. In 
[12] paper, ACE algorithm evaluates every node‚Äôs potential one by one for cluster head selection. 

3. Proposed Algorithm: Dynamic Cluster Head Selection Using Fuzzy Logic on Cloud in Wireless Sensor 
Networks (DCHFC) 

DCHFC operates in 4 phases 

ÔÇ∑  Malicious Node detection [7] and removal in WSN  
ÔÇ∑  Application of fuzzy logic to calculate Potential [12] for each node in Cloud 
ÔÇ∑  Cluster head selection with spatial distribution in Cloud 
ÔÇ∑  Clustering in WSN 

3.1. Malicious Node Detection and Removal 

A trust factor based malicious node detection algorithm [3] is used 

For each ith node: 
1.  Compute Trust Factor of ith node. 
2.  ùëáùêπi = 100(x^ùëõ) where ùëõi is the no of consecutive data packets dropped. 
3. 

If ùëáùêπi <= TTF (threshold trust factor) value then broadcast ùëñth node as malicious.  

All detected malicious nodes are then removed i.e. not considered for cluster head selection. 

3.2. Application of Fuzzy Logic to Calculate Potential for each Node 

Cloud calculates the Potential value for all nodes, except detected malicious nodes, in the wireless sensor network. 

Potential is calculated by the following input variables [4]: 

ÔÇ∑  Residual_Energy 
ÔÇ∑  Reachability 
ÔÇ∑  Reception_Power 

Where, Residual_Energy is the remaining energy in the node. Reachability is the measure of how accessible the 

node is to its neighboring nodes, which is defined as [4] 

ùëü(ùëñ) =

1

ùëÅ

(‚àë

ùëó=ùëÅ‚àí1
ùëó=1

ùëëùëñùëó

) 

         (1) 

Reception_Power is defined in [4] as Link Quality Indicator/Distance (LQI/Distance) of node from cloud. Distance is 
the distance between the node and cloud, and LQI has been defined in [8] can be determined by radio chips [9]. Nodes 
with higher Reception_Power are more likely to become cluster heads [10]. Fuzzy linguistic variables (Low, Medium

High) are assigned to each of these input variables as per their membership functions in [4]. Potential is determined 
by the Fuzzy rule base table for cluster head selection [4]. 

3.3. Cluster Head Selection with Spatial Distribution 

Initially  8-10%  of  the  nodes  (Pinitial)  with  highest  Potential  are  chosen  to  be  cluster  heads.  Then  onwards  each 
remaining node with the highest Potential is taken and its distance D to each of the cluster heads is calculated. If the 
minimum calculated distance Dmin > Dthreshhold the node is selected to be a cluster head, where Dthreshold is the minimum 
distance needed to be kept between two cluster heads.  If Dmin < Dthreshhold the node is rejected i.e. is not made a cluster 
head, to avoid cluster overlapping. 

3.4. Clustering in wireless sensor network 

Clustering is done in sensor network as per CHUFL rule [4], in which the selected cluster heads broadcast a message 
in  their  transmission  range.  Non-cluster  head  nodes  receive  the  broadcasted  message  and  select  the  source  of  the 
highest signal strength as its cluster head. On ties, the cluster head with least node ID is chosen. In figure (Fig. 1.) the 
simulation is carried out assuming that the signal strength is directly proportional to the distance D between nodes.

The simulation shows that DCHFC offers spatially distributed cluster heads and creates more clusters to cater to 
nodes at all distances. Spatially distributed clusters regulate the energy consumption of nodes in the WSN. DCHFC 
also rejects malicious nodes, resulting in a lower packet loss and higher throughput (Fig. 3.). Simulations show that 
total residual energy of nodes in DCHFC is higher compared to CHFUL(Fig. 4. a). DCHFC offers a prolonged network 
lifetime with its nodes surviving longer than CHUFL (Fig. 4. b.).

5. CONCLUSION 

Protocols  for  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  need  to  be  energy  efficient  to  prolong  network  lifetime.  To  achieve 
enhancement  in  network lifetime and reliable and efficient  communication  in WSNs, deploying a good clustering 
technique  is  essential.  The  proposed  algorithm  (DCHFC)  for  clustering  offers  spatially  distributed  cluster  heads 
selection, which reduces cluster overlapping. DCHFC detects malicious nodes and never allows them to be the cluster 
head; thereby DCHFC increases the reliability and makes sensor networks fault tolerant. Cluster head selection by 
DCHFC is based on potential value calculated using fuzzy. The spatial distribution of clusters prevents overlapping. 
Having all these features DCHFC proves to be the better choice for energy consumption and enhancement of network 
lifetime.
