replacement. Urbanization may result in ikization because that the  migration of population from 

rural regions to urban regions always give rise to abrupt changes of geographical environments and 

traditional culture. It is necessary to protect the geographical environment against disruption, and to 

inherit and develop traditional culture in order to avoid ikization of a nation. The approach to solving 

the problems caused by fast urbanization is to reconstruct geographical environment so that rural 

culture will be naturally replaced by urban culture.

1 Introduction 

Urbanization is a complex dynamic process based on growth of urban population and migration 

of rural population. A process of urbanization includes two nonlinear geographical processes: one 

is gradual increase in the proportion between urban population and total population, and the other, 

1 

 
 
 
 
is society changes of the people living in urbanized areas from a rural to an urban way of life (Knox, 

2005; Zhou, 1995). The former is a quantitative change, and the latter is a qualitative change. The 

former  indicates  movement  of  rural  population  to  the  urban  regions  and  concentration  of  urban 

people,  while  the  latter  is  also  known  as  urbanism,  which  is  actually  the  characteristic  way  of 

interaction between urban inhabitants and geographical environment (Knox and Marston, 2009). 

For the urbanized people, there are two significant changes. One is the environmental change, that 

is, the rural environment is replaced by urban environment; and the other, cultural change, that is, 

the rural culture is substituted with urban culture. 

As a whole, urbanization originates from industrialization. Without industrialization, there will 

be no urbanization in the modern sense (Knox and Marston, 2009). For a long time, the character 

of urbanization is regarded as positive. Seldom people think of it as a double-edged sword under 

certain  conditions  because  of  nonlinear  dynamics.  In  fact,  a  theory  study  has  shown  that  fast 

urbanization can cause periodic oscillation or even chaos of the proportion of people living in urban 

areas (Chen, 2009). The most terrible is that the bad way of urbanization can possibly give rise to 

ikization. The phenomenon of Iks was first found by anthropologists and biologists (Tainter, 2006; 

Thomas, 1974; Turnbull, 1972; Turnbull, 1978), but it is actually a problem of human geography 

(Chen, 2014a). However, it has not yet drawn extensive attention of geographers.   

In this paper, a hypothesis of ikization is presented that sudden and violent change of geographical 

environments results in dismantling of traditional culture, which then result in collective depravity 

of a nationality. The replacement dynamics, a new theory of nonlinear systems, can be employed to 

explore the causality between ikization and fast urbanization. After all, urbanization is in essence a 

process of population replacement (Chen, 2014b). The rest of the article is arranged as follows. In 

section 2, a hypothesis of ikization will be put forward, and the causes and effects of ikization will 

be expounded. In section 3, the relationships between urbanization and ikization will be revealed. 

The causes of ikization lie in abrupt changes of geographical environments and traditional culture. 

In section 4, the theory of replacement dynamics will be employed to interpret the possible modes 

of ikization proceeding from urbanization. Moreover, the city of Beijing will be taken as an example 

to confirm the fast urbanization of China. The study will be concluded by a summarization. The 

novelty  of  this  paper  rests  with  three  aspects.  First,  the  relationships  between  ikization  and  fast 

urbanization of China are disclosed. Second, three conceptual models of ikization is presented. Third, 
2 

 
the model of replacement dynamics is associated with the phenomena of ikization. 

2 A hypothesis of ikization 

2.1 The definition of ikization 

First of all, the concept of ikization should be illuminated. Ikization is a phenomenon of human 

geography, but it was first discussed in anthropology and biology instead of geography. Chen (2014a) 

coined  the  word  ikization  in  terms  of  the  small  tribe  of  Iks  in  Uganda.  The  people  of  Iks  were 

formerly nomadic hunters and gatherers in the mountain valleys of northern Uganda, a country of 

east-central Africa. However, because the government decided to construct a national park, that is, 

Kidepo Valley National Park, they were compelled by law to give up hunting in the valleys and 

become farmers on poor hillside soil (Turnbull, 1972). Since then, the tribe of Iks became a mean 

society (Thomas, 1974): “These people seem to be living together, clustered in small, dense villages, 

but they are really solitary, unrelated individuals with no evident use for each other. They talk, but 

only to make illtempered demands and cold refusals. They share nothing. They never sing. They 

turn the children out to forage as soon as they can walk, and desert the elders to starve whenever 

they can, and  the foraging children  snatch food  from  the mouths of  the helpless elders…..  They 

breed without love or even casual regard. They defecate on each other's doorsteps. They watch their 

neighbors for signs of misfortune, and only then do they laugh.” A British-American anthropologist, 

Colin  Turnbull  (1972),  found  this  tribe,  and  wrote  a  controversial  book  entitled  “The  Mountain 

People”. This book interested scientists (Thomas, 1974), but also attracted criticism from author’s 

peers  (Heine,  1985).  Some  scholars  regarded  that  “this  book  cannot  be  discussed  in  any  proper 

sociological terms, for we are provided with only snatches of data. ” (Beidelman,1973; Heine, 1985) 

Despite this objection, the book made the Ik people famous and become “literary symbols for the 

ultimate fate of disheartened, heartless mankind at large” (Thomas, 1974).   

The misfortune of Iks suggests that a tribe’s ikization arises from radical change of geographical 

environments  and  break  of  traditional  culture.  Sudden  and  violent  changes  of  geographical 

environments may induce discontinuity of inherent culture. Cultural rupture will bring about loss of 

people’s  sense  of  place and  result  in  collective  depravity  of  a  community  or  even  a  nationality. 

Actually, as indicated by the biologist, Thomas (1974), “the Iks have transformed themselves into 

an irreversibly disagreeable collection of unattached, brutish creatures, totally selfish and loveless, 
3 

 
in  response  to  the  dismantling  of  their  traditional  culture.”  There  are  two  concepts  that  can  be 

employed to describe the process of ikization: changes of geographical environment and cultural 

breaking (Chen, 2014a; Tainter, 2006; Turnbull, 1978). Both the environment variation and culture 

variation are involved with two aspects: one is absolute change, namely, devastation, and the other 

is relative change, that is, migration. 

Now,  a  conceptual  model  can  be  built  for  our  understanding  the  causality  of  ikization.  If  the 

degree of ikization is treated as a function (output variable, dependent variable, response variable), 

environmental  variance  and  cultural  break  can  be  regarded  as  two  arguments  (input  variables, 

independent  variables,  explanatory  variables).  Thus  the  causality  can  be  expressed  as  a  linear 

regression equation as below: 

,                    (1) 

where a refers to an intercept (constant), and b1 and b2 to regression coefficients reflecting the impact 

strength. Alternatively, the relationship between cause and effect of ikization can also be described 

by a production function, which is simple nonlinear regression equation, as follows 

,                        (2) 

where a denotes a constant, and b1 and b2 are two elasticity coefficients (Luo and Chen, 2014). 

No human culture is independent of its geographical environment. Human being depends on earth 

surface, and culture results from the interaction and ecological relationships between human being 

and  physical  environment.  In  this  sense,  equation  (2)  is  more  preferable  than  equation  (1),  but 

equation (1) is simpler and thus easier to understand than equation (2). In fact, we can find the third 

function to model the causality about geographical processes and ikization, which will be discussed 

in the fourth section. 

2.2 Political and economic movements resulting in ikization 

If we read the modern history of China, we can find that many events have brought about cultural 

catastrophes and environmental and ecological disasters. In some cases, a good motivation may lead 

to bad results. This implies the nonlinearity and thus complexity of social and economic systems. 

Today, the symptom of ikization has appeared among parts of Chinese people after a long latent 

period,  which  suggests  the  effect  of  time  lag  between  the  causes  and  effects  of  a  geographical

process.  Since  the  May  Fourth  Movement  (1919),  which  was  correlated  with  the  New  Culture 

Movement  (1915-1923),  Chinese  traditional  culture  has  been  questioned,  reconsidered,  or  even 

denied. This  movement  was  regarded  as  an  anti-imperialist  and  anti-feudal  political  and  cultural 

movement and thought to be a historical progress of China, but its aftereffects are very complicated. 

During  the  Great  Leap  Forward  and  the  People’s  Commune  Movement  (1958-1960),  which 

represents the high point of ignorant mass folly, Chinese geographical circumstances and conditions 

as well as ecological systems suffered serious destruction (Cannon and Jenkins, 1990). Especially, 

the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) gave rise to both environmental and cultural 

devastation. Since the introduction of the policies of reform and opening-up at the end of 1978 and 

with  the  gradual  establishment  of  a  socialist  market  economic  system  from  1992,  namely,  after 

Deng’s South Tour Speeches, China’s national economy and cities developed rapidly (Yang, 1998). 

However,  this  development  once  inflicted  heavy  losses  of  geographical  environments  due  to 

absence of a rule of law (Table 1). In recent years, the Chinese government has finally realized the 

importance of protecting the geographical environment. A series of new policies and measures have 

been  introduced,  which have  significantly  improved  China's  natural  environment  and  ecological 

conditions.

What is worth mentioning is that political and economic corruption represents a significant factor 

contributing to national ikization. In ancient China, corruption is an important ruling means used by 

almost all monarchs. If an emperor tried to plunder the national wealth through a state policy, he 

5 

 
 
 
would be regarded as a bandit and would result in loss of morale of nations. A foxy emperor never 

easily  robbed  the  people  of  their  wealth.  Instead,  he  would  rather  utilize  the  corrupt  officials  to 

plunder the wealth of the people. If a corrupt official knew when to stop and just leave, he will not 

be punished in accordance with the law. However, if he was excessively greedy of gain and have 

suffered the bitter hatred of the people, he would be chastised in the name of the law. His house 

would  be  searched  and  his  property,  of  course,  the  mammon  of  unrighteousness,  would  be 

confiscated and finally obtained by the emperor. The emperor would kill two birds with one stone 

by punishing the corrupt officials and family members seriously. First, he acquired the wealth from 

his subjects by an indirect means. Second, he was regarded as a wise monarch and won the support 

of  the  people.  For  the  emperor,  the  corrupt  officials  had  two  benefits.  First,  they  were  easily 

controlled because their handles were caught by the emperor. Second, they amassed huge wealth by 

plundering the national people for his monarch. What with the drawbacks of political institutions 

and what with the weakness of human nature, the corrupt officials emerged in an endless stream 

during the long process of Chinese history.   

In  modern  society,  the  source  of  political  corruption  is  the  very  source  of  unsustainable 

development. The ancient emperors didn’t care about official corruption, which, as indicated above, 

was  an  approach  for  the  emperors  to  make  a  fortune.  After  all,  the  officials  could  not  emigrate 

abroad, so they would not transfer the ill-gotten gains to the overseas. What is more, due to the 

technical  level,  the  extent  of  damage  to  the  geographical  environments  caused  by  the  official 

corruption was small. However, today, the situation is different from that in ancient times. In order 

to  acquire  immense  amount  of  treasure  through  exploitation  of  natural  resources,  the  corrupt 

officials always undermine environments crazily by colluding with merchants. Malfeasant official 

behaviors rely heavily on altisonant approaches such as reservoir resettlement and fast urbanization. 

Because of the advanced technology, it is easy for officers and businessmen to destroy the natural 

environments. In particular, they should not be responsible for the land as both the corrupt officials 

and illegal dealers can immigrate overseas. In a sense, modern corruption can cause great harm to 

the geographical environments and the relations between man and land, which lead to ikization of 

people, which in turn aggravate official corruption. Therewith a vicious circle comes into being, 

wrecking the country and bringing ruin to the people (Figure 1).

3 Urbanization and ikization 

3.1 The dynamics of urbanization 

Urbanization  may  be  one  of  significant  factors  of  ikization  in  the  history  of  mankind. 

Urbanization  implies  the  process  of  migration  of  rural  populations  into  cities  and  towns,  which 

results in an increasing proportion of the regional population residing in urban settlements. A city 

and a network of cities are complex spatial systems (Albeverio et al, 2008; Batty, 2005; Batty, 2013; 

Bertuglia et al, 1998; Wilson, 2000), and urbanization is a self-organizing process of urban evolution 

(Allen, 1997; Batty and Xie, 1999; Haken and Portugali, 1995; Portugali, 2000). In a sense, complex 

spatial patterns and self-organized processes represent the two different sides of the same coin of 

city  development.  The  dynamics  of  urbanization  can  be  understood  by  two  processes.  First, 

urbanization  indicates  a  kind  of  phase  transition  from  a  rural  to  an  urban  settlement  system 

(Anderson et al, 2002; Sanders et al, 1997). Phase transition is originally a physical term, which is 

often associated  with  the concept  of  self-organized  criticality  (SOC)  (Bak,  1996; Batty  and  Xie, 

1999). In physics, a phase transition denotes the transformation of a thermodynamic system from 

one state (e.g., liquid) of matter to another one (e.g., solid or gaseous) by heat transfer (Stanley, 

1971; Yeomans, 1992). Today, the term can be employed to describe an evolution of a geographical 

system from rural state into urban state by urbanization. Second, urbanization suggests a complex 

replacement dynamics: rural settlements are replaced by urban settlements, and rural population is 

replaced  by  urban  population  (Chen,  2012;  Chen,  2014b;  Rao  et  al,  1989).  In  essence,  phase 

transition  and  replacement  dynamics  also  represent  the  two  different  sides  of  the  same  coin  of 

urbanization.   

7 

 
 
In geography, urbanization involves both quality and quantity. A common knowledge is that the 

process  of  urbanization  involves  four  aspects:  urban  system,  urban  form,  urban  ecology,  and 

urbanism (Knox, 2005; Knox and Marston, 2009). Both urban system and urban form can be well 

described from the prospective of natural cities (Jiang and Miao, 2015; Jiang et al, 2015). However, 

it  is difficult  to  study  urban  ecology  and  urbanism  through  modern  technology. Among  the four 

aspects, urbanism reflects the quality of urbanization and is more correlated with ikization. The term 

“urbanism” suggests that the culture or way of rural life of the urbanized people is substituted with 

the urban culture or way of urban life. The ikization can be associated with urbanization because 

that the transfer of population from rural regions to urban regions may give rise to abrupt changes 

of geographical environments and traditional culture. 

3.2 Urbanization and ikization 

For the city dwellers, the phase transition of urbanization includes two replacement processes 

during rural-urban population migration. First, the rural geographical environment is replaced by 

urban geographical environment. Second, the rural culture of life way is replaced by urban culture 

or life way. Thus the original sense of places will be lost. It will take a long time for the migratory 

dwellers to form new sense of places. This may result in ikization (Figure 2). In fact, Thomas (1974) 

once pointed out: “Cities have all the Ik characteristics. They defecate on doorsteps, in rivers and 

lakes, their own or anyone else's. They leave rubbish. They detest all neighboring cities, give nothing 

away.  They  even  build  institutions  for  deserting  elders  out  of  sight.”  This  suggests  that  urban 

inhabitants look like Iks because of environmental and cultural changes.

8 

 
 
 
 
It is rapid urbanization instead of natural urbanization that results in ikization of a community or 

even a nationality. In China, ikization may proceed from fast urbanization because of large-scale 

demolition  of  traditional  urban  communities  and  rural  settlements.  A  new  word,  chaiqian,  has 

emerged  as  the  times  require.  Chaiqian  means  remove  and  relocation,  that  is,  dismantlement  of 

houses and movement of local residents. In many regions, government officials and business owners 

acted in collusion with each other to be engaged in rent-seeking of land. Many traditional settlements 

are  pulled  down,  and  local  residents  were  compelled  to  move  to  the  appointed  places  and  were 

relocated. Many people became landless peasants coming between urban state and rural state and 

form a kind of marginal people living at the edge of modern society. Their situations were similar 

to Iks. Overnight, their life way was thoroughly remodeled. In short, their living environments were 

suddenly changed, and their inherent culture was broken down. They felt that they  were rapidly 

transferred from one time and space to another time and space. 

4 Theoretical analyses 

4.1 Logistic replacement 

The process of urbanization is associated with spatial replacement dynamics. Replacements are 

ubiquitous phenomena in both nature and society, which always take on a sigmoid curve (Batten, 

1982;  Chen,  2012;  Fisher  and  Pry,  1971;  Hermann  and  Montroll,  1972;  Karmeshu  et  al,  1985; 

Montroll,  1978).  In  the  simplest  case,  the  replacement dynamics  can  be modeled  with  a  logistic 

function. Among various replacement processes, urbanization and urban growth are two kinds of 

typical geographical substitution. Urbanization is a process of urban-rural population replacement, 

which has been studying for many years (Chen, 2014b; Rao et al, 1989). A new finding is that urban 

growth  represents  a  complex  dynamics  of  spatial  replacement,  which  can  be  modeled  with 

Boltzmann’s equation and logistic function (Chen, 2012). Urban replacement is one of the nonlinear 

processes  of  geographical  replacement.  More  important  geo-replacement  is  that  natural 

environment is replaced by human systems by degrees. In geography, the very basic and significant 

topic  is  the  nonlinear  relation  between  man  (human  societies)  and  land  (natural  environment) 

(Martin, 2005). The man-land relation can be regarded as the most important ecological relation in 

this world. Because of the interaction between human being and the surface of Earth, the primary 

9 

 
productivity or even the secondary productivity are gradually consumed by humankind. So far, man 

has  used  up  more  than  40%  of  the  primary  productivity.  In  other  words,  human  being  has 

transformed the first nature into the second nature and the third nature (Chen, 2014b; Swaffield, 

2002).  To  characterize  this  replacement  process,  a  new  measurement,  the  ratio  of  the  primary 

productivity to the total productivity in a region, p(t), can be defined by 

,                                                        (3) 

where y represents the primary productivity, and x is the other productivity. Accordingly, the ratio 

of the other productivity to the primary productivity (POR) can be defined as o(t)=x(t)/y(t) (Chen, 

2014b).  Based  on  equation  (3),  a  logistic  model  of  man-land  replacement  can  be  built,  and  its 

mathematical expression is as below: 

,                                                          (4) 

in which p0 is the initial value of the productivity ratio p(t), i.e., the ratio of productivity of time t=0, 

k is the original rate of growth. 

Because of population explosion, natural space has been rapidly replaced by human space all over 

the world. In fact, human race depletes geographical environment so fast by predatory exploitation 

of natural resources that the man-land relation becomes unstable. If we look at the earth from space, 

we  will  be  surprised  at  its  change.  In  particular,  China  seen  from  the  satellite  is  like  a  piece  of 

withered and yellow leaf rather than a dark green leaf (Yu, 2006). We cannot find a place in our 

country as Land of Peach Blossoms, i.e., land of idyllic beauty. If things continue this way, periodic 

oscillations or even chaos may arise some day in the future (Chen, 2014b). If the ratio of the other 

productivity to the total productivity is substituted by the level of urbanization, L(t), we will have 

an logistic model of urban-rural replacement, that is 

,                                                            (5) 

where L0 is the initial value of the urbanization level L(t) at the time t=0, k is the inherent rate of 

growth of the ratio of urban population to total population.

4.2 Step replacement and ikization 

Logistic replacement is a natural replacement, which cannot result to ikization. Fast urbanization 

curve should  be described with  quadratic  logistic function,  and can  be  termed  quadratic  logistic 

replacement.  Both  logistic  replacement  and  quadratic  logistic  function  belong  to  sigmoid 

replacement. However, another type of geographical replacement, step replacement, will give rise 

to ikization. The so-called ikization is in fact a process of human replacement: noble people will be 

substituted  by  mean  people  (Figure  2).  The  step  replacement  is  a  dynamic  process  that  can  be 

characterized by the unit-step function 

,                                                                (6) 

where t0 denotes a critical time. The unit-step function can be treated as the extreme special case of 

the logistic function, or the logistic function can be thought of as a smooth approximation to the 

unit-step function. Actually, in equation (4), if t=0, we will have p(t)=p0=0, while if t→∞, then it 

follows  p(t)=1.  Therefore,  this  replacement  can  also  be  termed  0-1  replacement.  The  unit-step 

function can be employed to model the processes of substitution such as reservoir resettlement and 

large-scale dismantlement of houses and movement of local residents. For urbanization, three types 

of  replacement  dynamics  can  be  tabulated  and  illustrated  as  below  (Table  2,  Figure  3).  During 

urbanization, the original sense of places of the urbanized people gets lost, and it will take a long 

time for the migratory dwellers to form a new sense of place. The loss of place sense may be one of 

influencing factors of ikization.

the  ikization  process  can  be  depicted  with  a  unit-step  function,  equation  (6).  Based  on  the  step 

replacement, the conceptual model of ikization can be substituted with a logistic regression model 

in the following form 

,                                    (7) 

where a, b1, and b2 are parameters. In this instance, the degree of ikization will be measured with a 

dummy variable rather than a metric variable. A dummy variable is also known as a binary variable, 

Boolean indicator, categorical variable, design variable, indicator variable, or qualitative variable, 

which is always represented by 0 and 1 (Diebold, 2004; Kleinbaum et al, 1998). Now, we have three 

possible mathematical models to describe the causality of ikization (Table 3).

Because of the destruction of geographical environment and the rupture of traditional culture, the 

symptom of ikization seems to have appeared in partial Chinese people. Various phenomena of Iks 

such as corruption, indifference, schadenfreude, no sense of responsibility, and making counterfeit 

goods  have  been  discussed  in  detail  (Chen,  2014a).  On  the  other  hand,  the  problems  of  fast 

urbanization of China have been studied by many scholars from varied perspectives. However, the 

mathematical  modeling  and  quantitative  analyses  are  seldom  reported  on  rapid  urbanization  in 

literature. In China, the typical signs of fast urbanization are urban sprawl, bubble economy of real 

estate,  and  large-scale  demolition  of  traditional  settlements.  These  signs  are  correlated  with  one 

another. As indicated above, one of aspects of urbanization is urban form, which takes on sprawl 

during the stage of rapid urbanization. Beijing, the capital of China, can be regarded as a microcosm 

of China, which in turn can be treated as a macrocosm of Beijing. The models of a city’s growth is 

always consistent with the model of urbanization of its country. We might as well take Beijing as 

an example to illustrate the recent state of China’s fast urbanization.   

The  basic  tools  of  replacement  dynamics  including  squashing  functions,  sigmoid  curves,  and 

allometric equation can be utilized to analyze the rapid growth of Beijing city. The measurements 

comprise  the  traditional  measures,  urban  area  and  population  size,  and  the  new  measurement, 

scaling exponent. In theory, urban form is free of characteristic scale and cannot be described with 

common  measures  such  as  area  and  size.  Urban  area  can  be  subjectively  defined  rather  than 

objectively measured. At present, three approaches can be employed to designate metropolitan areas 

or demarcate urban agglomerations. The first is the city clustering algorithm (CCA) presented by 

Rozenfeld  et  al  (2008,  2011),  the  second  is  the  fractal-based  method  presented  by Tannier  et  al 

(2011), and the third is the variant of CCA based on street nodes/blocks developed by Jiang and Jia 

(2011). In this work, the metropolitan area of Beijing is determined by using CCA. By means of 

eight years of remote sensing data of urbanized area from 1984 to 2009 and the six times of census 

data of urban population from 1953 to 2010, we can examine the urban sprawl of Beijing in the past 

thirty years. 

The squashing functions include the conventional logistic function, fractional logistic function, 

and quadratic logistic function. The urbanized area of a city can be modeled with a fractional logistic 

function (Chen, 2014c). Based on the dataset consisting of 8 data points from 1984 to 2009 (Table 

13 

 
4), a model of Beijing’s area growth can be built as below 

,                                                        (8) 

where t denotes time, and A(t) refers to the urbanized area of time t. The goodness of fit is about 

R²=0.9964  (Figure  4).  In  terms  of  this  model,  the  inherent  rate  of  growth  of  urban  area  is 

approximately 0.0829.

Where Beijing is concerned, there are both similarities and differences between urban area and 

urban  population.  The  population  growth  of  Beijing  can  be  modeled  with  a  quadratic  logistic 

function (Chen, 2014b). Based on the dataset comprising six times of census data, a model can be 

made as follows 

,                                                        (9) 

where P(t) denotes the population size of time t. The goodness of fit is about R² = 0.9459 (Figure 

5). In light of this model, the inherent rate of growth of urban population is around 0.0295. The 

relative growth rate of urbanized area (0.0829) is significantly greater than that of urban population 

size  (0.0295).  Under  condition  of  normal  urbanization,  the  relative  growth  rate  of  urban  area  is 

supposed to be less than that of urban population.   

By  means  of  exponential  interpolation,  we can  complement  the population  dataset  of  Beijing. 

Then an allometric analysis can be made for the scaling relation between urbanized area and urban 

population. By the least squares calculations, an allometric growth model is obtained as below 

.                                                    (10) 

The goodness of fit is about R² = 0.9872 (Figure 6). According to this model, the allometric scaling 

exponent  is  approximately  2.22,  which  is  significantly  greater  than  1.  The  allometric  scaling 

exponent is the ratio of the relative growth rate of urban area to that of urban population: 

,                                                    (11) 

where σ denotes the allometric exponent. Generally speaking, the allometric scaling exponent comes 

between  2/3  and  1  (Chen,  2014c).  Once  again,  the  result  shows  that  the  relative  growth  rate  of 

urbanized area is greater than that of urban population size. This suggests the waste phenomenon in 

the land use of Beijing. Obviously, the conclusion drawn from equations (10) and (11) lends further 

support to the conclusion drawn from equations (8) and (9).   

In theory, a city has no characteristic scale and urban form and growth should be described with 

fractal dimension. Fractal dimension is a kind of scaling exponent indicating the extent of space 

filling and the degree of spatial complexity. The fractal dimension can be evaluated with the box-

counting method, and the fractal dimension growth can be modeled with sigmoid functions (Chen, 

15 

2)0295.0(3611.7123206725)(tetP2176.2)(0000003109.0)(tPtA2176.2)(/)(d)(/)(dtPtPtAtA 
2012). Based on the eight years of observational data (Table 4), the fractal dimension growth of 

Beijing can be modeled by a quadratic logistic function (Chen, 2018). The quadratic logistic growth 

comes  between  exponential  growth  and  the  conventional  logistic  growth. The  quadratic  logistic 

model suggests that the relative growth rate of urban sprawl is much higher than the relative growth 

rate under normal circumstances. As indicated above, a city’s growth is consistent with urbanization 

of a nation. The model of fractal dimension growth of Beijing’s urban form lends further support to 

the suggestion of fast urbanization of China.

city (1984-2013) 

Now,  based  on  mathematical  models  and  model  parameters,  two  criteria  associated  with 

replacement  dynamics  can  be  used  to  verify  fast  urbanization.  One  is  the  scaling  exponent  of 

allometric  growth  model,  and  the  other  is  the  latent  scaling  exponents  of  sigmoid  models.  The 

natural  urbanization  curve  can  be  described  with  the  conventional  logistic  function.  If  the 

urbanization curve exhibits a quadratic logistic function, the latent scaling exponent is 2, and thus 

it indicates fast urbanization. If the urbanization curve takes on a fractional logistic function, and 

the latent scaling exponent is significantly greater than 1, it suggests fast urbanization. In particular, 

if the allometric scaling exponent is greater than 1, which suggests the relative growth rate of urban 

area  is  significantly  greater  than  that  of  urban  population,  it  implies  fast  and  immoderate 

urbanization. Beijing is a megacity in the world. If the characters of fast urbanization appear in the 

middle-sized and small cities, the thing can be regarded as normal. However, a megacity such as 

Beijing shows varied signs of fast urbanization, it is abnormal. This suggests a sort of urbanization 

bubble or bubble economy behind urbanization, which in turn suggests environment disruption and 

cultural rupture. 

5 Conclusions 

In this paper, the concepts of urbanization, ikization, and replacement dynamics are associated 

with one another. The main points of this study are as follows. First, ikization is connected with 

nonlinear man-land relationships. The causes of ikization rest with sudden change of geographical 

environment  and  break  of  traditional  culture,  and  the  consequence  of  ikization  is  national 

degeneration. Environmental changes lead to loss of sense of place, which give rise to collective 

depravity of a nationality. Second, urbanization results in rapid change of geographical environment 

and  original  culture.  Because  of  migration  from  rural  places  to  urban  places,  people’s  living 

environment will be relatively changed, and meanwhile the rural culture will be suddenly substituted 

by  urban  culture.  Where  the  urbanized  population  is  concern,  the  original  sense  of  place  will 

disappear overnight. Third, the replacement dynamics can be employed to interpret the ikization 

resulting  from  urbanization.  Replacement  processes  can  be  divided  into  three  groups:  natural 

17 

 
 
replacement, rapid replacement, and step replacement. Natural replacement model can be used to 

describe  European  and American  urbanization,  rapid  replacement  model  can  be  used  to  reflect 

China’s  urbanization,  and  step  replacement  can  be  used  to  depict  large-scale  dismantlement  of 

houses  and  movement  of  local  residents.  It  is  the  step  replacement  rather  than  the  natural 

replacement that results in ikization of people in a region or subregions.   

There  is  always  a  time-lag  relation  between  causes  and  effects  in  the  evolution  of  complex 

systems. The past causes lead to the present and future effects, and the present causes lead to the 

future effects. Where there is time lag, there is nonlinearity; and where this is nonlinearity, there is 

complexity. The madness of men not only brings about the revenge of nature on human beings but 

also  results  in  the  fall  of  men  themselves.  The  large-scale  demolition  of  traditional  urban 

communities  and  rural  settlements  in  the  process  of  fast  urbanization  suggests  more  adverse 

outcomes related with ikization in the future. It is necessary to protect the geographical environment 

against  disruption,  and  to  inherit  and  develop  traditional  culture  in  order  to  avoid  ikization  of  a 

nationality. One of the important approaches to solving the problems caused by fast urbanization is 

to safeguard and reconstruct geographical environment so that rural situations and culture will be 

naturally replaced by urban situations and culture. Fortunately, Chinese government has realized the 

problems and taken positive measures to solve them.
