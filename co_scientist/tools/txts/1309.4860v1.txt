Abstract:  This  paper  is  mainly  devoted  to  lay  an  empirical  foundation  for  further  research  on 

complex spatial dynamics of two-population interaction. Based on the US population census data, 

a rural and urban population interaction model is developed. Subsequently a logistic equation on 

percentage  urban  is  derived  from  the  urbanization  model  so  that  spatial  interaction  can  be 

connected mathematically with logistic growth. The numerical experiment by using the discretized 

urban-rural population interaction model of urbanization shows a period-doubling bifurcation and 

chaotic behavior, which is identical in patterns to those from the simple mathematical models of 

logistic  growth  in  ecology.  This  suggests  that  the  complicated  dynamics  of  logistic  growth  may 

come from some kind of the nonlinear interaction. The results from this study help to understand 

urbanization,  urban-rural  population  interaction,  chaotic  dynamics,  and  spatial  complexity  of 

geographical systems.

1. Introduction 

The  study  of  the  logistic  equation  as  viewed  from  ecology  indicates  that  a  simple  deterministic 

system  can  present  periodic  oscillation  and  chaotic  behavior  along  with  the  model  parameter 

change  (May,  1976).  However,  why  the  simple  model  contains  complex  dynamics  still  remains 

ambiguous. Urban study can provide us with facilities for exploring the springhead of complicated 

dynamics  of  logistic  process.  In  the  urbanization  process,  the  level  of  urbanization  follows  the 

1

 
 
 
sigmoid curve and can be described with the logistic function (Karmeshu, 1988; United Nations, 

1980;  United  Nations,  1993).  Moreover,  the  urban  system  and  ecological  system  show 

comparability in several aspects (Dendrinos, 1992; Dendrinos and Mullally, 1985), which implies 

that  the  process  of  urbanization  might  have  period-doubling  bifurcation  or  chaotic  dynamics.  In 

theory,  urban  system  and  the  process  of  urbanization  can  generate  complex  behaviors  such  as 

chaos  (e.g.  Dendrinos,  1996;  Dendrinos  and  El  Naschie,  1994;  Nijkamp,  1990;  Nijkamp  and 

Reggiani,  1998;  Van  der  Leeuw  and  McGlade,  1997;  Wong  and  Fotheringham,  1990).  Many 

studies of chaotic cities are relative to spatial interaction and logistic growth. 

On  the other hand,  a great number  of  simulation  analyses  and  empirical  researches  show  that 

urban  system  bears  the  fractal  structure  (e.g.  Batty  and  Longley,  1994;  Chen  and  Zhou,  2003; 

Frankhauser,  1994;  White  and  Engelen,  1994).  Fractal  structure  and  chaotic  behavior  coexist  in 

lots of systems. Fractal property of urban systems suggests complex dynamics of urban evolution. 

What  we  concern  is  not  only  the  bifurcation  and  chaos  in  the  sheer  numerical  simulation 

experiments  but  also  the  ones  that  can  be  captured  from  the  observation  data.  One  of  the 

viewpoints is that fractal actually appears at the edge of chaos and the coexistence phenomenon of 

fractal and chaos does not imply the certain correlation between them (Bak, 1996). Perhaps this is 

true,  but  we  still  intend  to  investigate  it  from  the  standpoint  of  urban  systems  and  urbanization 

dynamics  in  order  to  reveal  the  relation  between  the  chaotic  behavior  and  fractal  structure  of 

nonlinear systems. 

Now  chaotic  cities  and  fractal  cities  have  become  important  branch  ranges  of  self-organized 

cities  (Portugali,  2000).  Fractal  cities  mean  the  cities  with  self-similarity  or  scaling  invariance, 

while chaotic cities suggest the cities with spatial regularity behind random behaviors. The studies 

of fractal cities and systems of cities are supported by a great number of observations (e.g. Batty 

and Longley, 1994; Chen and Zhou, 2004; Chen and Zhou, 2006; Frankhauser, 1994; White et al, 

1997).  However,  most  applications of  chaos  theory  in the  social  sciences  lack  empirical  content 

(Nijkamp and Reggiani, 1992). This situation has changed little for more than ten years. In fact, 

cities  and  networks  of  cities  are  typical  complex  systems  suitable  for  exploring  complicated 

dynamics (Allen, 1997; Wilson, 2000). The key lies in how to associate theory with practice and 

reality. The principal aim of this paper is at two aspects. One is to lay an empirical foundation for 

researching  chaotic  cities,  and  the  other  is  to  prepare  for  revealing  the  essence  of  complicated 

2

 
behaviors of simple models and the relation between chaotic cities and fractal cities. 

The following parts of this paper are structured as follows. In section 2, we build a nonlinear 

dynamics  model  about  the  urban-rural  interaction  based  on  the  population  census  data  of  the 

United States of America (USA), and then derive the logistic equation of urbanization level from 

the  model.  In  section  3,  with  the  aid  of  the  US  census  data,  we  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and 

rationality  of  the  model  based  on  statistical  analysis,  logistic  analysis  and  numerical  simulation 

analysis. This part is used to consolidate the empirical foundation of the model. In section 4, we 

implement numerical simulation experiment with the model of urbanization dynamics, testifying 

whether or not such a model presents all the behavior characters of the logistic equation, including 

periodic  oscillation  and  chaotic  behavior.  Finally,  in  Section  5,  the  discussion  is  concluded  by 

making some remarks on the significance of the complicated dynamics research from the aspect of 

the two-population interaction in urban geography. 

2 Choice and Transform of Mathematical Models 

2.1 Urban-rural interaction models 

A variety of mathematical models has been made to describe the spatial dynamics of the urban-

rural  population  migration.  Among  these  models,  two  are  attention-getting.  One  is  the  Keyfitz-

Rogers  linear  model  (Keyfitz,  1980;  Rogers,  1968),  and  the  other,  the  United  Nations  nonlinear 

model (United Nations, 1980; Karmeshu, 1988). The United Nations adopted a pair of nonlinear 

equations to characterize the urbanization dynamics

where r(t) and u(t) denotes the rural and urban population in time t respectively, a, b, c, d, φ and ψ 

are parameters. If parameters φ=ψ=0, we can derive the logistic model of urbanization level from 

the UN model. For many years, the United Nations has been using the logistic function to forecast 

the  level  of  urbanization  of  each  country  in  the  world  (United  Nations,  1993;  United  Nations, 

2004). 

However,  empirical  studies  and  statistical  analyses  show  that  the  urbanization  dynamics  of 

3

 
many  countries  such  as  America,  China,  and  India  can  be  effectively  described  neither  by  the 

Keyfitz-Rogers  model  nor  by  the  United  Nations  model.  In  short,  rural  population  couldn’t 

migrate  into  urban  regions  and  vice  versa  without  spatial  interaction  between  urban  and  rural 

population. In other words, population migration and exchange between urban and rural regions 

depends  only  on  urban-rural  population  interaction.  Consequently,  two  items  of  the  United 

Nations model are actually excrescent and equation (1) should be simplified to such a form

.                                                    (2) 

According to equation (2), the rural population can not spontaneously flow into the cities and vice 

versa.  The  exchange  of  urban  and  rural  population  relies  mainly  on  the  urban-rural  interaction. 

The  urban-rural  interaction  bears  an  analogy  with  the  predator-prey  interaction  in  ecology 

(Dendrinos  and  Mullally,  1985).  The  size  of  urban  population  is  influenced  by  rural  population 

size  and  in  turn  reacts  on  it.  So  both  the  growth  rate  of  urban  population  and  that  of  rural 

population  depend  to  a  great  extent  on  the  coupling  or  cross  correlation  between  the  urban  and 

rural population. For a close region, it is theoretically expected b=d. As will be shown later, the 

US model of urbanization dynamics might be simpler than equation (2). That is c=0 in reality. 

2.2 Derivation of the logistic model 

In order to research into the above model, we need to examine it from two ways: one is the logical 

analysis, and the other empirical analysis. The logical analysis involves at least two aspects. First, 

whether  or  not  the  level  of  urbanization  derived  from  the  above  model  is  close  to  the  logistic 

increase, and whether or not the total population in a region is limited. Second, whether or not the 

result of the numerical simulation is coincident with that of the mathematical deduction. 

First,  we  derive  the  well-known  logistic  model  on  the  level  of  urbanization,  i.e. urbanization 

ratio.  The  level  of  urbanization  is  defined  as  the  proportion  or  share  of  urban  population  in 

relation to the total population in a region (United Nations, 2004). Thus, we have

where  L(t)  refers  to  the  level  of  urbanization,  P(t)=r(t)+u(t)  to  the  total  population,  and 

V(t)=u(t)/r(t) to the urban-rural ratio of population. Differentiating, we get

For simplicity, taking a region as a close system, then we have b=d. In terms of the definition of

This  implies  1/V(t)=r(t)/u(t)=1/L(t)-1.  Therefore,  equation  (6)  can  be  transformed  into  a  logistic 

equation

Thus, we have constructed a mathematical relation between models for two interacting population 

and the logistic growth. Let k=b+c-a=c+d-a represent the intrinsic rate of growth. Then equation 

(8) can be simplified as the usual form

Solving equation (9) yields the well-known expression of the logistic curve

where L0 represents the initial value of L(t). That is, when t=0, we have L(t)= L0. 

A  key  criterion  to judge the  urbanization model  is  the  rationality  of  the  increase  curve  of  the 

total population. Taking derivative of population P(t) with respect to time t gives

Obviously, from equation (12) we can get two inconsistent equations as follows

According to equation (13), when a>c, the total population grows more quickly; while according 

to  equation  (14),  when  a>c,  the  total  regional  population  grows  slower.  These  two  equations 

collide with each other. The inconsistency can be eliminated by two conditions: a=c or c=0. If a=c 

as  given,  then  the  total  population  will  grow  infinitely  in  the  exponential  way  predicted  by 

Malthus  (1798/1996);  On  the  other,  if  c=0,  the  total  population  will  stop  growing  when  it 

increases  to  certain  extent.  Under  the  latter  circumstance,  according  as  equation  (13),  since  the 

rural population r(t)→0, the growth rate of the total population P(t) will gradually decrease to 0; 

According  as  equation  (14),  because  the  whole  population  will  be  completely  urbanized,  i.e. 

u(t)→P(t), the growth rate of the total population will tend toward 0 ultimately. In the real world, 

we do have c=0, as will be illustrated in the following empirical analysis. 

It is easy to see that b or d is a very significant parameter in equation (2). On the one hand, it 

controls the developing trend and quantity of the total population; on the other hand, it affects the 

original  rate  of  growth  k  value  of  the  logistic  equation  on  level  of  urbanization.  As  we  know, 

parameter k dominates the behavior characters of the dynamical system. When k>2.57, the logistic 

map coming from the discretization of equation (9) will present very complicated behaviors (May, 

1976).  So  what  is  the  case  in  reality?  In  the  next  section,  we  will  validate  the  above  models  in 

virtue  of  the US  observation  data.  Then we  perform  numerical  simulation experiment  to  unfold 

some intrinsic regularity of the urbanization dynamics. 

3 Empirical Foundation of Two-population Interaction Model 

3.1 Data and method 

The main purpose of this study, as indicated above, is to lay an empirical foundation for further 

research  on  complex  spatial  dynamics  of  urban-rural  interaction.  So  it  is  necessary  to  make 

6

 
relevant statistical analysis of the dynamical equations. There are two central variables in the study 

of spatial dynamics of urban development: population and wealth (Dendrinos, 1992). According to 

our theme, we only choose the first variable, population, to test the models. Generally speaking, 

the population measure falls roughly into four categories: rural population r(t), urban population 

u(t), total population P(t)= r(t)+u(t), and level of urbanization, L(t)= u(t)/ P(t). 

The  American  data  comes  from  the  population  censuses  whose  interval  is  about  10  years. 

Although the website of American population census offers 22 times of census data from 1790 to 

2000,  we only  use the data  from  1790 to  1960  (table 1).  The  reason is  that  the  US  changed  the 

definition  of  cities  in  1950,  and  the  new  definition  came  into  effect  in  1970.  From  then  on,  the 

American urban population was measured with the new standard. As a result, the statistic caliber 

of the population data from 1970 to 2000 might be different from those before 1970 although they 

approximately join with each other (figure 1).

The data displayed in table 1 are fitted to the discretization expressions of the United Nations 

model and the Lotka-Volterra-type model respectively (r.e. Dendrinos and Mullally, 1985; Lotka, 

1956; Volterra, 1931). Since the Keyfitz-Rogers model and the American urbanization model are 

both  special  cases  of  the  United  Nations  model,  there  is  no  need  to  try  Keyfitz-Rogers  model 

particularly.  The  parameters  of  models  are  made  by  the  least  squares  computation,  which  can 

make the key parameters, slopes, fall into the most reasonable range. 

After  estimating  the  model  parameters,  we  should  make  tests  in  two  ways.  One  is  the  well-

known  statistical  test,  and  the  other  is  the  logical  test,  which  is  often  ignored  in  practice.  If  the 

model fails to pass the statistical test, it has problems such as incomplete or redundant variables, 

or inaccurate parameter values; if the model cannot pass the logical test, it has structure problem 

so  that  it  cannot  explain  the  phenomena  at  present  and  predict  the  developing  trend  in  future. 

Statistical tests can be made in definite procedure, while the logical test needs to be done with the 

help of mathematical transformation and numerical simulation experiment.

(Notes: The solid points are data from 1790 to 1960; the hollow points are data from 1970 to 2000. The definition 

of the city after 1960 is different from before, but the two calibers generally fit with each other.) 

3.2 Parameters estimation and model selection 

In  order  to  make  statistical  analysis,  we  must  discretize  the  United  Nations  model  so  that  it 

transform  from  differential  equations  into  difference  expressions,  i.e.,  a  2-dimension  map.  Then 

the analysis of continuous dynamics changes to that of discrete dynamics. If ∆t=10 as taken, then

∆r(t)/∆t be dependent variables. A multivariate stepwise regression analysis based on least squares 

computation gives the following model

This is a pair of difference equations of which all kinds of statistics including F statistic, P value 

(or t statistic), variance inflation factor (VIF) value and Durbin-Watson (DW) value can pass the 

tests  at  the  significance  level  of  α=0.01  (Appendix  1).  In  this  model,  c=0.  Although  we  should 

have b=d in theory, they are not equal in the empirical results. There might be two reasons for this. 

One is that the US is not a truly closed system because of mass foreign migration; the other is that 

the natural growth of the urban population is dependent on the urban-rural interaction. The second 

reason might be more important. But on the whole, the equations as a special case of the United 

Nations model can better describe the American urban and rural population migration process in 

the recent 200 years. 

In light of equation (10), the level of urbanization should follow the logistic curve. It is easy to 

calculate the urbanization ratio using the data in table 1. A least squares computation involving the 

percentage urban data gives the following results

k=0.02238  as  the  estimated  value  of  the  intrinsic  growth  rate.  On  the  other  hand,  we  could 

estimate  the  original  rate  of  growth  k  value  by  equation  (15):  one  is  k1=b-a=0.03615-

0.02584=0.01031,  and  the  other  is  k2=d-a=0.05044-0.02584=0.02460.  The  intrinsic  growth  rate 

should come into between k1=0.01031 and k2=0.03615 and indeed it does. The parameter values 

estimated  from  the  dynamical  system  model,  equation  (15),  are  similar  to  that  from  the  logistic 

model, equation (16). There are some differences between different estimated results due mainly 

to  three  factors.  The  first  is  non-closed  region,  the  second  imprecise  data,  and  the  third  the 

computation error resulting from transformation from continuous equation to discrete expression. 

For comparison and selection, we also fit the American rural and urban data to the discretization 

9

 
of  the  predator-prey  interaction  model.  Let  r(t),  u(t)  and  r(t)*u(t)  be  independent  variables  and 

∆u(t)/∆t  or  ∆r(t)/∆t  dependent  variables.  The  multivariable  stepwise  regression  based  on  least 

squares  computation  gives  an  abnormal  result,  which  cannot  be  accepted.  If  we  loosen  the 

requirements, then the American urbanization process could be expressed with the Keyfitz model. 

However, this mathematical expression has two vital shortcomings, which defies us to accept the 

Keyfitz model for the US urbanization. In short, neither the linear Keyfitz-Rogers model nor the 

usual non-linear Lotka-Volterra  model is as good as the United Nations model in terms of logic 

sense and statistic effect (Appendix 2).

Figure 2 Logistic process of the US level of urbanization (1790-2000) 

(Note: The solid points are the data from 1790 to 1960, and the hollow points the data from 1970 to 2000) 

We  can  generate  the  data  of  American  urban,  rural  and  total  population  and  the  urbanization 

level by using discrete dynamics model, and then draw a comparison between the simulation value 

and  observed  data.  Figures  3  and  4  respectively  show  the  simulation  results  based  on  equations 

(15). It is easy to see that the change of the urban and total population approximately follow the 

path  of  the  S-curve,  while  the  rural  population  first  increases,  then  decreases,  and  finally  turns 

itself  into  the  urban  population  completely  (figure  3).  Moreover,  the  level  of  urbanization 

increases  in  the  logistic  way  (figure  4).  The  changing  trend  of  the  numerical  simulation  results 

displayed in figures 3 and 4 is roughly coincident with the actual observation data (figures 1 and 

2).  Although  it  is  unpractical  that  the  saturation  value  of  the  urbanization  level  is  100%,  the 

characters  of  evolvement  of  the  urban  and  rural  population  reflected  by  the  discrete  dynamical 

10

 
 
 
 
model, i.e., equation (15), comply with logic rules well. The total population converges, and the 

change of the percentage urban conforms to the logistic curve.

shape to that of logistic growth indicated by equation (16)) 

To  sum  up,  the  American  model  of  urban-rural  population  interaction  can  be  expressed  by 

equation (2) but the parameter c=0. This is the experimental foundation of theoretical analysis of 

discrete  urbanization  dynamics.  So  far,  we  have  finished  the  building  work  of  the  model  of 

urbanization based on the population observation in the real world. In the following section, we 

11

 
 
 
 
 
will  discuss  the  complicated  behaviors  of  the  above  model  of  urbanization  dynamics  in  the 

possible world in theory. 

4 Complex Behaviors of Urbanization Dynamics 

One of the purposes of this work is to prepare for revealing the essence of complicated behaviors 

of  simple  models.  The discrete  equations  of  two-population  interaction  between  urban  and  rural 

systems  can  exhibit  all  the  complex  dynamics  arising  from  the  logistic  map,  including  period-

doubling bifurcation and chaos. Chaos theory is a field on the random behavior and latent order of 

certain dynamical systems, which are highly sensitive to initial conditions (Malanson, et al, 1990). 

Chaos  is  often  defined  as  intrinsic  unpredictability  of  deterministic  systems.  In  other  words,  a 

difference  equation  is  regarded  as  a  chaotic  system  if  the  solution  to  the  equation  is  sensitively 

dependent on its initial conditions.   

The  discrete  urban-rural  interaction  model  can  show  richer  details  of  complicated  behaviors 

than  what  logistic  map  does,  and  especially,  it  can  offer  a  new  way  of  looking  at  complex 

dynamics  of  simple  mathematical  models.  According  as  equation  (15),  the  parameter  c=0,  thus 

equation (8) can be reduced to

Defining a new variable xt=kLt/(1+k), we can turn equation (18) into the familiar parabola, i.e., a 

1-dimension map xt+1=(1+k)xt(1-xt). 

As we know, according to May (1976), the quadratic map can present periodic oscillation and 

even more complicated chaotic behaviors under certain conditions. Since equation (17) is derived 

from equation (2), the behavior characters of equation (18) should be able to be produced by the 

discretization  of  equation  (2).  For  testing  this  hypothesis,  we  can  perform  some  numerical 

simulation experiment by using equation (2), which can be discretized as a 2-dimension map

The conversion between differential equation and difference will result in some subtle change of 

parameter  values.  But  for  simplicity,  we  don’t  modify  the  parameter  symbols  after  converting 

equation  (2)  into  equation  (19).  The  numerical  solutions  of  equation  (19)  shows  that  when  the 

difference between b and a increases (please notice k=b-a), the growth curve of urbanization level 

Lt indeed changes from simplicity to complexity, from S shape to periodic oscillation and even to 

chaos. In short, all the behaviors of logistic map revealed by May (1976) can be exhibited by the 

discrete two-population interaction model (Figure 5).

fixed state to chaos 
(Notes: The parameter values are taken as a=0.025, c=0. In order to correspond to the logistic model, we make b=d. 

The initial urban and rural population values are based on the US census in 1790, i.e., r(0)=r0=3,727,559, 

u(0)=u0=201,655. It is easy to see that the numerical simulation results from the two-population interaction model 

13

 
 
 
are identical in curves to those from the logistic model by May in 1976) 

As  a  matter  of  conciseness,  we  may  as  well  set  b=d  based  on  the  theoretical  hypothesis. 

According to the estimated results of the US urbanization model, let a=0.025 and c=0. In addition, 

the US census data in 1790 are taken as the original urban and rural population values. Then, we 

increase  the  value  of  b  and  d  continually.  The  numerical  simulation  result  shows  that  when 

b=d<1.31, the urbanization level presents the S-shaped curve growth, i.e. a fixed state curve; when 

b=d>2.025  (k=b-a>2),  the  dynamical  system  comes  into  2-period  oscillation  state;  when 

b=d>2.475 (k=b-a>2.45), the system takes on 4-period oscillation state; then the system will fall 

into  8,  16,  and  2n-period  state  as  the  values  of  b  and  d  increase  (n  is  a  positive  integer);  when 

b=d>2.6  (k=b-a>2.575),  the  system  will  perform  random  period  or  chaotic  state.  The  growing 

limit  of  parameters  is  b=d=3.03.  Compared  with  the  work  of  May  (1976),  the  period-doubling 

bifurcation route to chaos of the discrete urban-rural interaction model is identical in patterns to 

that  of  the  logistic  map.  Of  course,  there  might  be  subtle  difference  sometimes.  Why  the  2-

dimension map exhibits the same complex dynamics with that arising from the 1-dimension map? 

Maybe  the  two-population  interaction  model  poses  a  new  question  about  the  essence  of  chaos 

(Figure 6).

Figure 6 A 1-dimension map and a 2-dimension map reach the same goal by different routes 

Further, if we ignore the connection between the urban-rural interaction model and the logistic 

equation by permitting b≠d, then the behavior features of the dynamical system will become much 

14

 
 
 
 
richer. When we fix a, c, and d, the system will exhibit periodic oscillation or even chaos; however, 

when we fix b, the behavior characters of the system do not change along with the changes of the 

other parameters. It is obvious that the key parameter that determines the system behavior is b, or 

strictly speaking, is the difference between a and b. In detail, for instance, let’s consider a=0.025, 

c=0, and d=0.05 according to the aforementioned empirical analysis. The curve of the urbanization 

level changes along with b is in the same way with the result based on b=d, but the critical values 

of the period-doubling bifurcation route to chaos increases. 

Under the circumstances, when the system comes into the chaotic state, it still presents periodic 

oscillation. However, the period is not only a multiple of 2 any more, but a random integer. For 

example, when b=3.2, system will enter into period 5 state (figure 7). More experimental results 

show that system will present period 3 or period 6 in the chaotic state. This illustrates the well-

known Sharkovsky’s theorem, and remind us of Li and Yorke (1975)’s discovery. The proposition 

“period  three  implies  chaos”  can  be  expressed  equivalently  as  “period  any  number  beyond  2-

multiple implies chaos”.

Figure 7 Period 5 oscillation of urbanization level: a special chaotic state 

(Note: The parameter values are such as a=0.025, b=3.2, c=0, d=0.05) 

Based  on  the  above  simulation  analysis,  we  can  reach  conclusions  as  follows.  First,  the  key 

element  of  the  urbanization  process  lies  in  rural  population  rather  than  urban  population. 

According as the dynamical model of urbanization for America, the non-linear term of urban-rural 

interaction  connects  the  city  on  one  end  and  the  village  on  the  other.  It  is  the  difference  of 

15

 
 
 
parameters  a  and  b  that  dominates  the  behavior  features  of  the  urbanization  dynamics.  This 

implies  that  it  is  the  rural  region  and  urban-rural  interaction  that  determine  the  progress  of 

urbanization.  Secondly,  only  when  b=d,  there  is  strict  mathematical  relation  between  the  urban-

rural interaction model and the logistic equation. On the one hand, the logistic model parameter 

derived by mathematics is k=b-a, whose value controls the behavior characters of the logistic map; 

on the other, numerical simulation shows that it is the value of (b-a) that determines the behavior 

of  the  urban-rural  interaction  model.  Evidently,  the  precondition  of  connecting  the  urban-rural 

interaction  model  with  the  logistic  equation  is  b=d.  Third,  the  periodic  oscillation  and  chaotic 

behavior  of  urban-rural  interaction  maybe  only  belong  to  the  results  of  the  sheer  theoretical 

analysis. As we know, since the number of the urban and rural population can not be negative in 

reality, namely r(t)≥0 and u(t)≥0, it is certain that L(t)≤1 in terms of equation (3). However, if the 

dynamic system exhibits periodic oscillation or even chaotic behavior, the simulation value of the 

rural  population  will  be  negative,  namely  r(t)<0.  Thus  the  numerical  simulation  shows  the 

abnormal  phenomenon  of  urbanization  ratio  L(t)>1  (see  figures  7).  Actually,  this  case  is 

impossible. So period-doubling bifurcation and chaos of urbanization seem not to happen in the 

real world, it only appears in the imaginary world as a theoretical product (Chen, 2009). 

For  the  sake  of  understanding  the  essence  of  complex  dynamics,  let’s  implement  a  simple 

mathematical transformation. Removing the nonlinear terms indicating interaction in equation (2) 

yields

Although  equation  (20)  also  leads  to  logistic  equation,  the  dynamical  patterns  of  the  linear 

differential  equations  are  very  simple.  The  numerical  simulation  based  on  the  discretization  of 

equation (20) shows no periodic oscillation, say nothing of chaos. This suggests that complicated 

dynamics such as period-doubling bifurcation and chaos coming from the logistic map is in fact 

rooted in interaction associated with nonlinearity. 

An  allometric  scaling  relation  between  urban  population  and  rural  population  can  be  derived

rural and urban population respectively. Apparently, the allometric scaling exponent σ is given by

where Du refers to the fractal dimension of urban population, and Dr to the fractal dimension of 

rural population. This suggests that the logistic equation and the related transformation may be the 

mathematical link between the chaos and fractals of urban evolvement. 

Another  interesting  discovery  is  that  the  logistic  equation  comes  between  the  exponential 

growth  models  indicating  simplicity,  equation  (20),  and  the  two-population  interaction  model 

indicating  complexity,  equation  (2).  This  reminds  us  that  the  logistic  model  maybe  implies  a 

mathematical transform between simple expressions and complex dynamics. As space is limited, it 

is impossible to make all these questions clear here and the pending questions will be discussed in 

future reports. 

5 Conclusions 

Urbanization  is  a  complex  process  of  spatial  dynamics  with  two-population  interaction.  The 

mathematical model based on the US observation data can be proposed to describe the nonlinear 

evolvement.  From  the  urban-rural  interaction  model,  we  can  strictly  derive  the  logistic  equation 

about level of urbanization. As logistic growth exists widely in the nature and human society, the 

17

 
two-population interaction model may reflect a kind of ubiquitous dynamical systems. Therefore, 

some research conclusions can be generalized to other fields, including ecology, economics, and 

geology. Furthermore, since the logistic model is related to chaos, this implies that the process of 

urbanization  has  the  potential  possibility  to  bear  periodical  oscillation  and  chaotic  behavior. 

Accordingly,  the  urban-rural  nonlinear  interaction  models  could  help  us  better  understand  the 

urban  system  by  chaos  theory,  and  meanwhile  comprehend  more  the  nature  of  chaos  by  urban 

evolution. The main conclusions of this article are summarized as follows. 

First, the urban-rural population interaction model can exhibit periodical oscillation and chaotic 

behavior in theory. The period-doubling bifurcation diagram route to chaos is identical in patterns 

to that from the logistic model in ecology. This provides us a new perspective to understand the 

complicated  dynamics  of  simple  systems.  The  numerical  simulations  show  that  the  urban-rural 

population  interaction  model  can  exhibit  2-period  oscillation,  4-period  oscillation,  …,  2n-period 

oscillation, and finally chaos, along with the change of parameter values. The changing regularity 

reminds  us  of  the  logistic  map.  Further  research  suggests  that  the  discrete  two-population 

interaction model can tell us more about the complex systems than what the logistic model does. 

Secondly,  complicated  dynamics  such  as  period-doubling  bifurcation  and  chaos  result  from 

interaction instead of sheer logistic processes. The logistic model on the level of urbanization can 

be derived not only from urban-rural population interaction models, but also from the allometric 

equations of rural and urban population growth. However, the behavior patterns of the exponential 

growth  models  are very  simple.  In  other  words,  periodical oscillation  and chaotic  behaviors  can 

never  be  generated  by  means  of  the  exponential  growth  equations.  This  implies  that  no 

complicated dynamics appears without interaction between rural and urban population. 

Thirdly,  the  logistic  equation  may  possibly  form  a  mathematics  transform  relation  between 

simplicity and complexity, which provide us a new way to look at complexity. As indicated above, 

the  logistic  model  can  be  derived  from  the  urban-rural  interaction  models  or  from  a  pair  of 

exponential  equations.  This  suggests  that  the  logistic  equation  may  act  as  the  mathematical 

transform  from  the  nonlinear  interaction  models  to  the  simple  linear  equations.  Such  a  relation 

may become a bridge connecting simplicity and complexity. In particular, if such transform can be 

testified to have universal property, it can be developed into a fire-new logistic transform method. 

If so, the transform will probably associate the unanalysable nonlinear equation with simple rules 

18

 
and take the opportunity to solve some long-standing unanalysable nonlinear problems.

If this model is employed to describe the growth of the rural population, the saturation value of the 

urbanization ratio will be less than 1, which tallies with the actual situation better. However, this 

model gives rise to two problems. First, the model cannot avoid multi-collinearity, which could be 

22

 
 
 
 
 
detected from the VIF value in Table A2. Second, based on the model, the total population will not 

converge but increase infinitely.

The first equation has serious problems. Firstly, the estimated values of the parameters cannot pass 

logical test. The coefficient of the linear term, u(t) should be positive, but it is here negative. The 

physical meaning of the negative coefficient is inexplainable. What is more, the coefficient of the 

non-linear  term,  i.e.,  the  cross  term,  r(t)u(t),  should  be  negative,  indicating  that  the  urban-rural 

interaction  can  transform  the  rural  population  into  the  urban  population,  but  it  is  positive  here. 

This  conflicts  with  the  symbol  of  the  non-linear  term  of  the  second  equation,  in  which  the 

coefficient value of the cross term is positive, too.   

Secondly, some values fail to pass the statistic test either. VIF value is far more than 10, which 

implies that there exists serious multi-collinearity between the three independent variables. If we 

eliminate the non-linear term, then new problems will rise. The test of serial correlation of residual 

errors can not be acceptable (DW=1.082), and the symbol problem of the linear term u(t) remains 

unresolved. If we further remove the linear term u(t), then the DW value will decrease to 0.527, 

which is more unacceptable (Table A3, Table A4). This suggests that the variables are insufficient, 

or the serial correlation is serious, either of which is against the basic rules of regression modeling. 

As for the second equation, nothing seems wrong statistically, but it cannot be understood in logic. 

According  to  this  equation,  the  rural  population  will  automatically  flow  into  cities  without  the 

urban-rural interaction and the urban population will increase without any relation to itself.

This  mathematical  expression  has  two  vital  shortcomings.  The  first  is  the  logical  problem. 

According as the model, urban population, rural population and the total population will increase 

exponentially  without  any  limit,  which  is  against  our  common  sense.  The  second  is  the  statistic 

problem. That is, the second equation can not pass the DW-test (Table A3, Table A4).
