                 Abstract  

               Objective: The main objective of this paper is to construct a distributed clustering 
algorithm  based  upon  spatial  data  correlation  among  sensor  nodes  and  perform  data 
accuracy  for  each  distributed  cluster  at  their  respective  cluster  head  node.  Design 
Procedure/Approach:  We  investigate  that  due  to  deployment  of  high  density  of  sensor 
nodes in the sensor field, spatial data are highly correlated among sensor nodes in spatial 
domain.  Based  on  high  data  correlation  among  sensor  nodes,  we  propose  a  non  -
overlapping  irregular  distributed  clustering  algorithm  with  different  sizes  to  collect  most 
accurate or precise data at the cluster head node for each respective distributed cluster. To 
collect  the  most  accurate  data  at  the  cluster  head  node  for  each  distributed  cluster  in 
sensor field, we propose a Data accuracy model and compare the results with Information 
accuracy model. Finding: Simulation results shows that our propose Data accuracy model 
collects  more  accurate  data  and  gives  better  performance  than  Information  accuracy 
model  at  the  cluster  head  node  for  each  respective  distributed  cluster  in  our  propose 
distributed  clustering  algorithm.Morover  there  exist  a  optimal  cluster  of  sensor  nodes 
which is adequate to perform approximately the same data accuracy achieve by a cluster. 
Practical  Implementation:  Measuring  humidity  and  moisture  content  in  an  agricultural 
field, measuring temperature in physical environment. Inventive /Novel Idea: A distributed 
clustering  algorithm  is  proposed  based  on  spatial  data  correlation  among  sensor  nodes 
with Data accuracy model.

1.  Introduction 

    Recent  development  of  wireless  technology  and  embedded  system  made  a  drastic  improvement 
over  wireless  sensor  networks.  Due  to  ease  of  deployment  and  reliable  cost,  sensor  networks  are 
used  in  many  applications  to  sense  or  collect  the  physical  phenomenon  of  raw  data  for  any  event 
such as temperature, humidity, seismic event, fire, etc from the physical environment  [1]. A small 
processing unit device called node captures the physical phenomenon of raw data from the physical 
environment. These nodes can process the raw data, communicate wirelessly among other nodes and 
finally transmits the collected raw data to the base station or sink node.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    Generally the physically sensed data collected by the sensor nodes are spatially correlated [2] in 
the  sensor  field.  If  the  deployed  density  of  sensor  nodes  increases,  the  spatially  proximal  sensor 
observations  are  highly  correlated  [3]  in  the  sensor  field.  Since  the  sensor  observations  are  highly 
correlated among sensor nodes, the sensor nodes form distributed clusters [4] in the sensor field to 
minimize data collection cost [5]. According to literature survey, LEACH [6] demonstrates a clear 
concept about distributed dynamic cluster formation according to priori probability. Each distributed 
cluster has respective Cluster Head (CH) [7] node which aggregates the data collected from all the 
sensor nodes in the cluster and finally transmits the processed data to the sink node. Moreover SEP 
[8]  gives  the  cluster  formation  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks.  Literature  [3,  9]  shows  the 
spatial correlation of  observed data  among sensor nodes to form distributed clusters.  A grid based 
clustering method proposed in literature [10] shows a spatial correlation model for cluster formation. 
Basically this type of theoretical clustering model rarely happens in practical scenario in the sensor 
field. A disk-shaped circular cluster proposed in literature [11] shows grouping of nodes into disjoint 
set each managed by a designated CH node. However formation of disk shape cluster doesn’t really 
appears in original scenario. Most of the cases, cluster formation are irregular in shape and size the 
in spatial domain. In literature [4] authors proposed a distributed clustering algorithm with different 
shape and size based upon shortest distance among sensor nodes and CH nodes in spatial domain. 
Here in this paper, we propose a formation of distributed clustering algorithm based upon spatially 
correlated data among sensor nodes. Our propose model for distributed clustering algorithm which 
form  irregular  shape  and  size  is  much  more  practical  than  the  previously  proposed  clustering 
algorithm in spatial domain. As the numbers of sensor nodes are more in the sensor field, the data 
correlation  among  the  sensor  nodes  increases  [3]  and  form  distributed  clusters  for  high  density  of 
sensor  nodes  in  our  clustering  algorithm.  Thus  finally  we  form  spatially  correlated  distributed 
irregular  non  overlapping  clusters  of  different  sizes  with  high  density  of  sensor  nodes  in  spatial 
domain.  More  over  the  size  of  each  distributed  cluster  in  our  algorithm  is  based  upon  a  threshold 
value given in data correlation model [4] in spatial domain. 
      In  literature  [12,  13,  14],  authors  proposed  Information  accuracy  (distortion  function)  model 
where base station or sink node can estimate the information accuracy for observed data sensed by 
all  the  sensor  nodes.  These  types  of  model  are  based  on  one  hop  communication  where  observed 
data are sensed by all the sensor nodes and directly transmit the observed data to the sink node. But 
in literature [4, 15] authors proposed two hop communication where observed data are transmitted to 
the sink node via intermediate node (CH node) where the sensor field is large. Again in this paper, 
we consider two hop communications for our distributed clustering algorithm based on spatial data 
correlation  among  sensor  nodes  in  which  observed  data  are  transmitted  to  the  sink  node  via  CH 
node.  From  literature  survey,  it  has  been  noted  that  estimated  data  collected  from  all  the  sensor 
nodes  in  a  cluster  are  directly  send  to  CH  node  for  aggregation[24,25]  without  verifying  the 
accuracy. Hence it is important to verify the estimated data before data aggregation at CH node and 
then send it to the sink node. For each distributed cluster, the data accuracy is verified using MMSE 
estimator  [23]  before  data  aggregation  and  then  only  transmits  the  most  accurate  data  to  the  sink 
node. Thus verifying data accuracy at CH node before data aggregation for each distributed cluster 
may  reduce  communication  overhead.  It  may  possible  that  some  of  the  sensor  nodes  in  the 
distributed cluster get malicious [16] due to external physical environment .In such tropical situation 
sensor  nodes  can  sense  and  read  inaccurate  data.  These  inaccurate  data  transmitted  by  malicious 
nodes  may  cause  incorrect  data  aggregation  at  the  CH  node  for  respective  clusters.  Hence  it  is 
required to estimate and verify the data accuracy before data aggregation in the CH node for each 
distributed cluster to reduce data redundancy and power consumption. 

       In  this  paper,  we  propose  Data  accuracy  model  where  we  use  Minimum  Mean  Square  Error 
(MMSE) estimation to perform data accuracy at the CH node before data aggregation [17] for each 
distributed cluster. Most of the work done [12, 18] till today is to perform MMSE estimation at each 
individual sensor nodes for the observed data before transmitting the estimated data at the CH1 node 
in  a  cluster.  According  to  literature  [18],  once  the  estimated  data  is  received  at  the  CH  node 
transmitted by all the sensor nodes in a cluster, averaging the estimated data at CH node and finally 
transmits the most accurate data to the sink node. However to the best understanding of authors, this 
is the first time to perform MMSE estimation only at the CH node for all the observed data sensed 
by all the sensor nodes in a cluster .In our Data accuracy model, calculating MMSE estimation only 
at the CH node for the observed data sensed by all the sensor nodes in a cluster can increase the data 
accuracy and reduce the communication overhead before data aggregation.  
       Rest  of  the  paper  is  given  as  follows.  In  section-2,  we  construct  a  data  correlation  model  [4] 
among  sensor  nodes  in  spatial  domain.  Data  correlation  model  shows  the  degree  of  correlation 
coefficient for observed data among sensor nodes. The degree of correlation coefficient for observed 
data are  measured  by an assumed threshold value. If the correlation coefficients for observed data 
among  sensor  nodes  are  greater  than  the  threshold  value,  observed  data  are  spatially  correlated 
among sensor nodes in spatial domain otherwise not. Ultimately from this threshold value, we get an 
approximated  circular  data  correlation  range  among  sensor  nodes.  The  size  of  this  approximated 
circular data correlation range depends upon the threshold value. The sensor nodes which fall with in 
this circular data correlation range, the spatial data among them are highly correlated in the spatial 
domain. Hence the correlation coefficients for observed data among these sensor nodes are greater 
than  the  threshold  value.  In  section-3,  we  propose  a  distributed  clustering  algorithm  based  upon  
spatial  correlation  for  observed  data  among  sensor  nodes  in  the  sensor  field  .It  forms  non  over-
lapping  irregular  shape  and  size  of  different  distributed  clusters  in  the  spatial  domain.  Once  the 
distributed clusters are formed in the sensor field, each cluster can perform the data accuracy at their 
respective  CH  node  and  transmit  the  most  accurate  data  to  the  sink  node  which  is  discussed  in 
section-4.  We  also  construct  a  Data  accuracy  model  and  compare  it  with  Information  accuracy 
model with respect to data accuracy. In section 5, we perform the simulation and validation for our 
proposed distributed clustering algorithm and Data accuracy model. Finally we conclude our work in 
section 6. 

2.  Data Correlation Model in Spatial Domain 

j to  sense  or  measure  a  tracing  point  [4] i

      In this section, we are interested to illustrate the spatial data correlation among sensor nodes  i  
i  in  a  spatial  domain.  Tracing  point  is  a 
S   for 
and 
reference  value  which  we  are  interested  to  measure  and  sense  in  the  spatial  domain.  For  example 
tracing  point  has  higher  concentration  of  moisture  content  in  an  agricultural  field.  It  has  higher 
concentration  of  data  with  higher  variation  with  respect  to  lower  variation  of  data  in  the  spatial 
among 
domain. As the sensor node density increases, the spatial correlation of observed data  (

the sensor nodes  i  and  j  also increases in the spatial domain. The sensor nodes sense and measure 
the tracing point over a window frame of time interval   T to capture the continuous data sample with  
Si={ si1 ,  si2, si3, ……..sin } and Sj={sj1 ,  sj2, sj3, ……..sjn} respectively. If the tracing point sensed and 
measured by the sensor nodes  i and j located near to each other, the data correlation is strong. The 

1 According to literature [18] CH node is only a logical entity and can also be called as sink node depending upon applications. 

 
 
                                                 
data correlation decreases as the sensor nodes  i and j are far apart from the tracing point. The sensor 
nodes  i and j can compute the mean of continuous data sample over a window frame of time interval 
T. Thus the mean of continuous data sample sensed and measured by sensor nodes  i and j are given 
as follows.

We compute the variance of continuous sample data captured by the sensor nodes  i and j  in spatial 
domain.  Variance  is  used  to  measure  how  far  a  set of continuous  data sample of sensor nodes are 
spread out from each other. Thus the sensor nodes compute the variance of sample data as follows.

Thus  equation  no.  (4)  shows  the  data  correlation  between  the  sample  data  among  sensor  nodes 
i and j   in  the  spatial  domain.  These  spatially  correlated  data  among  sensor  nodes  i and j   can  be

      3. Distributed Clustering Algorithm based on Spatial Data Correlation 

      In  this  section,  we  propose  a  distributed  clustering  algorithm  which  forms  non  overlapping 
clusters of irregular shape and size in the sensor field. If the deployed sensor nodes increases in the 
sensor  field,  the  spatial  data  correlation  among  the  sensor  nodes  increases.  Based  upon  the  spatial 
cir i in  the  sensor  field,  we  construct  the 
data  correlation  among  the  sensor  nodes  for  each 
distributed clustering algorithm.

      We  consider  a  rectangular  sensor  field  where  M sensor  nodes  are  randomly  deployed.  We 
assume  that  every  sensor  nodes  knows  the  position  of  the  coordinates  of  all  sensor  nodes  in  the 
sensor field like MTE routing [6] to simplify the deployment topology. In the previous section, we 
cir i for each sensor node  i in the sensor 
clarify that for a threshold value, we get the radius  r of 
field. Hence we fix a threshold value for which we get radius  r of an appropriate size of 
cir i for 
( )
each  sensor  node  i   in  the  sensor  region.  This  means  that  each  sensor  node  i   perform  the  data 
correlation  with  the  neighboring  [26,  27]  sensor  nodes  j   to  form 
( )G i within  the  data  correlation

overlapping  of  many  data  correlation  range  area  occurs  in  the  sensor  field.  Overlapping  of  spatial 
data  correlation  for 
can  share  the  same  correlated  overlapping  of  data  among

   Therefore  we  construct  a  non  overlapping  distributed  clustering  algorithm  in  this  section  based 
upon  spatial  data  correlation  among  sensor  nodes  in  the  sensor  field.  In  the  next  section  we  are 
interested to find the data accuracy estimation for each distributed cluster and send the most accurate 
data to the sink node. 

     4. Distributed Cluster-based Data Accuracy Model  

     In  the  previous  section,  we  develop  a  non-overlapping  distributed  clustering  algorithm  with 
irregular  shape  and  size  in  the  sensor  field  based  upon  data  correlation  among  sensor  nodes.  We 
assume  each  distributed  cluster  can  sense  and  measure  a  single  tracing  point  of  same  event  and 
perform the data accuracy for the measured data at the CH node for the respective cluster. Finally 
CH node of each distributed cluster transmits the most accurate data to the sink node in the sensor 
region. Each distributed cluster has different set of sensor nodes to perform the data accuracy. The 
data  accuracy  is  perform  to  verify  the  estimated  data  received  at  the  CH  node  from  all  the  sensor 
nodes for a cluster are most accurate and doesn’t contain any redundant data in it. It may reduce the 
communication overhead.  

     For  the  simplest  analysis  of  our  propose  Data  accuracy  model,  we  choose  a  single  cluster 
of M sensor nodes.  Cluster with  M sensor nodes can sense a single tracing point and check the data 
accuracy at the CH node before data aggregation and then transmit the most accurate data to the sink 
node. Here we demonstrate the mathematical analysis of data accuracy for a single cluster with M  
sensor  nodes.  Each  sensor  node  i can  observe  and  measure  the  physically  sensed  data  Si   for  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
tracing point value  S  with observation noise 
the sensor node  i in a cluster is illustrated as  

in  for the cluster. Therefore the observation done by

ix  and transmits 
     The sensor node  i sense the observation sample data

ix  to the CH node sharing 
in  is independent of each

n .  Thus  the 
observation  sample  data 
ix   passes  through  AWGN  channel  to  the  CH  node  for  the  cluster  which 
reconstructs estimation  ˆS  of the tracing point S . The CH node receive all  M observation sample for 
the cluster given by  

                                                               X

AD M calculated  at  the  CH  node  for  each  distributed  cluster  is  performed  before  data  aggregation 
and finally send the most appropriate data to the sink node. Hence the purpose of verifying the data 
AD M at  CH  node  for  each  distributed  cluster  is  to  confirm  that  the  most  accurate  data 
accuracy 
transmitted by  M sensor node can aggregate rather than aggregating all the redundant data at the CH 
TR at the CH node for each 
node. Once we perform the estimation to calculate the data accuracy 
distributed cluster, the most precise data get aggregated and finally send to the sink node. 
       The information accuracy model proposed in literature [18] shows that at first each sensor nodes 
iS for observed data and then transmits the estimated data  ˆSi  to 
i  can calculate the MMSE estimate  ˆ
the  CH  node  i.e.  ˆSi in  order  to  find ˆS .  Finally  averaging  all  ˆ
iS at  the  CH  node  for  the  cluster  for 
M sensor  nodes  to  get  ˆS .But  in  Data  accuracy  model

performing  the  MMSE  estimation  at  individual  nodes  and  then  averaging  it  at  the  CH  node  for

     Data correlation model discussed in section-2, shows that the spatial correlation for observed data 
( Si  and S j ) among sensor nodes  i and j . Spatial correlations for observed data are strong when it is 
greater  than  some  threshold  value.  So  we  fixed  a  threshold  value    for 0
1  .  Above  this 
threshold value  , spatial data are strongly correlated among sensor nodes  i and j . Depending upon 
the  threshold  value    ,we  get  a  radius  r for  each  sensor  node  i to  perform  data  correlation  with 
cir i   around  each

cir i for node  i  with data correlation radius of  r  , data are

strongly  correlated  with  other  nodes j .    So  in  the  first  simulation  setup,  we  clarify  the  relation 
between    and r .  In  the  Fig.  1(a),  we  plot  the  relation  between  threshold  values    and  the 
corresponding  size  of  data  correlation  radius  r   for  node  i   of
cir i .  If  the  threshold  value   
cir i   decreases  exponentially.  In  Fig.

increases  for  0
1(b), we show the sizes of data correlation radius  r for node  i  of 
cir i   and the average number of 
( )
clusters based on spatial correlation for threshold values =0.5. If  r of 
cir i  increases, the size of 
cir i   increases  for 
2 =1  and  the  average  number  of  distributed  clusters    based  on  spatial 
correlation (discussed in section -3) decreases exponentially. 
 grid based sensor topology 
        In the second simulation set up, we have a sensor field of  2
with CH node on one of the corner edge and a fixed tracing point located in the center as given in 
Fig .2 according to literature [18]. We deployed thirty four sensor nodes and a CH node which forms 
a  cluster  in  grid  based  sensor  topology.  We  are  interested  to  demonstrate  the  data  accuracy  with 
respect  to  the  number  of  sensor  nodes.  We  set  the  same  sensor  field  topology  (Fig.2)  as  given  in 
literature [18] where the position of sensing nodes are located at point (6,2),(8,4),(6,4),(4,4) and the 
I M in 
tracing  point  at  (6,4).  For  these  four  jointly  sensing  nodes,  the  information  accuracy

AD M is 0.7545. This shows our propose

(
proposed in literature [18] for the same sensor nodes with same topology. Moreover, if we introduce 
a fifth sensing node located at (10, 4), the information accuracy 
I M  is 0.7462. This clarifies that 
(
introduce of a fifth node which is far away from the tracing point dominates its observation results

and  decreases  the  information  accuracy.  But  in  our  Data  accuracy  model 
fifth node may increase the data accuracy of 0.7665. Hence introduce of a new sensor nodes in the 
AD M .  Fig.3  shows  that  the  results  for  data 
sensor  field  increase  data  accuracy  in  our  propose
accuracy

number  of  sensor  nodes  for

         Moreover, if we continuously increase the number of sensor nodes in the sensor field, the data 
accuracy remains approximately same. Fig. 3 shows fifteen to twenty sensor nodes are sufficient to 
perform the same data accuracy level which we achieve for thirty four sensor nodes. Hence we can 
reduce  the  number  of  sensor  nodes  in  a  cluster  with  respect  to  data  accuracy.  It  is  unnecessary  to 
deploy thirty four sensor nodes beyond this upper bound because fifteen to twenty sensor nodes are 
sufficient to give approximately the same data accuracy level achieve in the cluster. Hence fifteen to 
twenty  sensor  nodes  perform  the  data  accuracy  at  the  CH  node  for  the  cluster  and  transmit  the 
accurate  data  to  the  sink  node.  Thus  fifteen  to  twenty  sensor  nodes  (optimal  cluster)  perform  the 
communication process and rest of the sensor nodes goes to sleep mode in the cluster .Reducing the 
number  of  sensor  nodes  to  fifteen  to  twenty  sensor  nodes  instead  of    deploying  thirty  four  sensor 
nodes  can reduce communication overhead as well as energy consumption in a cluster.

     In  the  third  simulation  setup,  we  have  fixed  number  of  sensor  nodes  (

single cluster to sense and measure a single tracing point. We place four sensor nodes in a deployed 
circular cluster and set a tracing point at the central co-ordinate of deployed circular cluster as shown 
in Fig.4 (a). Since we have fixed number of sensor nodes, we vary the distance from  M number of 
sensor nodes from the tracing point S  in a deployed circular topology. As we increase the radius of 
the  deployed  circular  cluster  with  same  proportion  from  the  tracing  point  S   as  a  centre,  data 
accuracy decreases for the value

located randomly with in the cluster. In a practical scenario, signal and noise variance of observed 
data  changes  with  different  location  in  the  sensor  field.  For  example  the  temperature  variation 
changes from place to place in a tropical dense forest. Thus we adopt slightly different signal and 
noise variance of observed data for each distributed cluster in the sensor field. Once each distributed 
cluster can measure the observed data for tracing point S , it calculates the data accuracy at the CH

      6. Conclusions 

      We  conclude  in  this  paper  that  a  non  overlapping  distributed  clustering  algorithm  based  upon 
data correlation among sensor nodes is proposed which reduces the data redundancy in the wireless 
sensor networks. We perform data accuracy for each distributed cluster at their respective CH node 
based on spatial correlation of data which shows that our propose Data accuracy model collects more 
accurate  data  and  give  better  performance  than  Information  accuracy  model.  Moreover  our 
simulation results shows there exist an optimal cluster which is sufficient to perform approximately 
the same data accuracy level achieve by a cluster. In a cluster, the optimal cluster can perform the 
data accuracy at the CH node and rest of the sensor nodes goes in sleep mode. Thus it may reduce 
the  communication  overhead,  energy  consumption  and  increase  the  life  time  of  distributed  sensor 
networks.
