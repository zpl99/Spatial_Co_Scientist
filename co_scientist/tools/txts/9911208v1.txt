Abstract

The passage from angular to spatial correlations, in the case of spatial clustering
length depending on the average distance between nearby objects is studied. We
show that, in a number of cases, the scaling law of angular correlation amplitudes,
which holds for constant spatial clustering length, is still true also for a luminosity
dependent spatial correlation. If the Limber equation is then naively used to ob-
tain ‘the’ spatial clustering length from the angular function amplitude, a quantity
close to the average object separation is obtained. The case of cluster clustering is
explicitly considered.

Introduction

Initial studies on clustering properties over large scales were performed using
2–dimensional samples (Totsuji & Kihara 1969, Peebles 1980; see also Sharp,
Bonometto & Lucchin 1984). Spatial properties were then deduced from an-
gular ones using the Limber equation (Limber 1953). However, even in the

present epoch of large redshift samples, the technique used to pass from angu-
lar to spatial statistical properties is far from becoming obsolete. For instance,
cluster samples are available and in preparation, selected with a ﬁxed apparent
magnitude limit. Even though the typical redshift of each cluster is given, the
diﬀerent intrinsical luminosity limit at diﬀerent distances forces to cut oﬀ some
information, to extract volume and intrinsical magnitude limited subsamples,
where the spatial 2–point function can be directly estimated. Working out
the angular function and using the Limber equation to extract spatial proper-
ties, might then seem a more convenient alternative approach. This approach
was followed, e.g., by Dalton et al (1997), when discussing the clustering of
clusters in catalogues extracted from the APM Galaxy Survey. In the ﬁnal
section we shall comment on the results of their analysis. The point is that
this approach meets a diﬀerent obstacle, as the cluster correlation length rc
may depend on cluster luminosities L (see Bahcall & West 1988 for a review
of Abell cluster clustering data; see Nichol et al 1992, Dalton et al 1994, Croft
et al 1997, for APM cluster clustering data; the whole set of data has been
recently reanalysed by Lee & Park (1999), with the inclusion of X–ray catalog
data).

Owing also to the diﬀerent deﬁnition of clusters in diﬀerent observational
samples or simulations, it is usual to work out from the cumulative cluster lu-
minosity functions n(> L) the average distance between nearby objects DL ≡
n−1/3(> L) and to seek the dependence of rc on DL. For 30 h−1Mpc
(h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km/s/Mpc), the Bahcall & West
(1988) conjecture that

< DL
∼

< 60 h−1Mpc
∼

rc ≃

0.4DL

(1.1)

approaches most data, although, clearly, it cannot be considered an obser-
vational output. However, over greater scales, there is no agreement among
results obtained from diﬀerent samples and it is not clear how much this may
depend on the diﬀerent cluster deﬁnitions. For Abell clusters, however, eq.
90 h−1Mpc. In this work, we shall assume the
(1.1) approaches data up to
validity of eq. (1.1), as an example of gross discrepancy from assuming that
rc is L–independent.

∼

In the presence of such kind of L–dependence, two questions arise: (i) As a
byproduct of the Limber equation, a scaling law holds, among the coeﬃcients
of the angular functions for samples with diﬀerent limiting magnitudes. Is
such scaling law still valid? We shall show that the same scaling law holds
in the case (1.1), as in the constant rc case. (ii) If the Limber equation is
then formally used to work out the spatial clustering length, which value
of rc is obtained? We shall show that a naive use of the standard Limber
equation leads to working out an apparent correlation length, close to the
average distance between nearby clusters for the whole sample.

As is obvious, our treatment applies to any kind of objects, not to clusters only.

2

Furthermore, the law (1.1) can be relaxed in various ways, obtaining related
results, provided that the luminosity dependence of the clustering length (rc)
can be expressed through a function of the mutual distance of the objects be-
longing to an intrinsical luminosity limited set (DL). Such generalizations will
not be debated here. Our treatment also neglects departures from euclidean
geometry and κ–correction. Their inclusion does not change the conclusions
of the paper, although slightly complicating ﬁnal expressions; of course, for
several detailed applications, they are to be included, but, at this stage, they
are unessential to make our points.

In order to show our points, we shall ﬁrst need to reobtain the Limber equation
in a way slightly diﬀerent from textbooks (see, e.g., Peebles 1980a); this is the
content of section 2 and 3. Using algorithms and expressions deduced in these
sections, in section 4 we show the points made in the Introduction. Section 5
contains a few ﬁnal remarks.

2 Sample deﬁnition

The Limber equation was introduced to work out the spatial 2–point corre-
lation function from angular data assuming that: (i) the 2-point function is
luminosity independent; (ii) there exists a universal luminosity function for
the class of objects considered.

If the objects are galaxies, the luminosity function can be given the Schechter
form (Schechter 1976):

φ(L) =

−α

φ∗
L∗ (cid:18)

L
L∗ (cid:19)

exp

L
L∗ (cid:19)

(cid:18)−

(2.1)

Here α(
1.1–1.2) is a phaenomenological parameter; L∗ is a typical galaxy
luminosity, close to the top luminosity of the sample. The number density of
galaxies with luminosity exceeding L reads

∼

∞

n(> L) =

dL φ(L) = φ∗U(L/L∗)

(2.2)

with

ZL

U(λ) =

∞

Zλ

du u−α exp(u)

(2.3)

and, henceforth, φ(L) =

dn(> L)/dL.

−

If we deal with clusters or other kinds of objects, the expression (2.1) may
no longer be a fair approximation. In the sequel, however, we shall only need

3

that n(> L) can be expressed as in eq. (2.2), even though U(λ) has not the
expression (2.3). In eq. (2.2), φ∗ should be expressed in Mpc−3h3 and approach
the total number density for the class of objects considered and, of course,
there must also exist a typical luminosity L∗, even though the distribution
around it is not given by eq. (2.1). As previously stated, let us then deﬁne

clearly dn/dD =

DL ≡
3/D4.

(2.4)

The apparent luminosity of a source of intrinsical luminosity L, at a distance
r from the observer, is l = L/4πr2 and the depth d∗ of a sample of objects,
with apparent luminosity l > lm, is deﬁned so that

lm = L∗/4πd2

∗ .

(2.5)

Hence, requiring that an object at distance r has l > lm, means that its
intrinsical luminosity

L > L∗(r/d∗)2 .

(2.6)

For instance, the angular density of objects, in a sample of depth d∗, reads

nΩ(d∗) =

Let us ﬁrst review the standard case, when also the assumption (i) holds,
i.e. ζ = (r0/r)γ with constant (luminosity independent) γ and r0 (correlation
length). In this case, changing integration variables, eq. (3.1) immediately

In above relations, the distances DL were used, instead of the number densities
n(> L) = D−3
L , which might even seem more convenient, in order to facilitate
the forthcoming passage to the case of luminosity dependent correlations.

Eq. (3.5) puts in evidence the scaling properties of the angular 2–point func-
tion. The only dependence on the depth of the sample (d∗) is factorized, as
Aγ is a universal expression (still, provided that φ(L) is a universal distribu-
tion). It is often stated that such scaling is arises from the fact that r0 does
not depend on luminosities. Here we shall verify that such scaling is a more
general property.

4 The case of luminosity–dependent correlations

In the case of galaxy clusters, we shall now assume that the Bahcall and West
conjecture holds:

ξ(r12, > L) = a (DL/r12)γ .

L = n(> L) is the number density
Here the numerical constant a
of clusters with luminosity > L (see eq. 2.5). Eq. (4.1) is an integral corre-
lation law, as it concerns all objects with luminosities above L. In principle,
it is possible to deﬁne also a diﬀerential correlation law, holding if objects of
intrinsical luminosities L1 and L2 only are considered. Such diﬀerential law is
not to be measured, but we want to show that, the integral expression (4.1)
follows from assuming that the diﬀerential law

(4.1)

ζ(r12, L1, L2) = ζ∗(

holds, provided that a = ζ∗(1

Let us now use the expression (4.2) to work out the angular function. In this
case the correlation length has a precise dependence on luminosities. In spite
of that, we shall ﬁnd that eq. (3.5) is still formally true and, in particular w(θ)
has the same scaling properties as in the case of luminosity independent r0.

In fact, if we replace the expression (4.2) in eq. (3.1) and perform the opera-

the expression (4.12) give results approximated up to some percents, provided

5 Final remarks

According to Peebles (1980a), the scaling relation (3.5) played an important
role in testing that the angular correlations of galaxies in the catalogs do reﬂect
the presence of a uniform spatial galaxy clustering, rather than something else,
e.g. systematic errors due to patchy obscuration in the Milky Way. This work
does not contradict such statement, corresponding to the point (ii) at the
beginning of section 2. However, Hauser and Peebles (1973), in their seminal
work on cluster clustering, made use of the scaling relation (3.5), as a test for
30 h−1Mpc they obtained for Abell clusters.
the cluster correlation length rc ∼
This test, as we showed, has only a partial validity.

≃

For the sake of curiosity, let us outline that, if the galaxy luminosity function
values, φ∗
10−2 and α
1.2 are used in eq. (4.11), we obtain a galaxy
≃
6 h−1Mpc, for γ values in the interal 1.6–1.9. This
correlation length rg ≃
output should not be overstressed, as it has been known for a long time that
the average distance between nearby galaxies Dg and the galaxy correlation
length rg have close values. In the case of galaxies, there is little evidence of
a linear relation between rg values and Dg values for intrinsical magnitude
limited samples. However, as galaxy luminosities essentially arise from stellar
populations, they may be subject to signiﬁcant variations, as their stellar
and dust contents evolve on time scales certainly longer than observational
times (see, e.g., Silva et al 1999). It is possible that the proximity of rg and
Dg indicates that, averaging luminosities over suitable time scales, a relation
similar to clusters holds also for galaxies.

In the case of galaxy clusters, Dalton et al (1997) investigated the scaling
properties of the angular functions for two diﬀerent samples with apparent
magnitudes m > 18.94 and 19.3 < m < 19.5, for which they had obtained
suitable U(λ) expressions. Assuming a constant spatial clustering length rc,
they obtained that the predicted scaling properties hold, while γ = 2.14 and
rc = 14.3 h−1Mpc. According to this work, ﬁnding a fair scaling does not
require a constant rc and, henceforth, any conclusion based on its existence is
somehow premature.
