**Toolset:** Find Locations

**Tool:** Find Dwell Locations

**Description:**  
The "Find Dwell Locations" tool is designed to identify locations where moving objects have stopped or dwelled, using specified time and distance thresholds. This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where understanding the stationary behavior of tracked objects is crucial. For example, it can be used to analyze the stopping points of delivery vehicles, identify areas where wildlife pauses during migration, or determine idle times for machinery in industrial settings. The tool processes time-enabled point features, which represent instances in time, to detect sequential observations with minimal movement over a defined period. The output can represent dwell features as points, convex hulls, or mean centers, providing flexibility in how results are visualized and interpreted.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Features:** The point tracks in which dwells will be found. The input must be a time-enabled layer with features that represent instants in time.  
  *Type:* Feature Set.
  
- **Output Dataset:** The name of the output feature service.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Track Fields:** One or more fields that will be used to identify unique tracks.  
  *Type:* Field.
  
- **Distance Method:** Specifies how the distances between dwell features will be calculated. Options include Geodesic and Planar.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Distance Tolerance:** The maximum distance between points to be considered a single dwell location.  
  *Type:* Linear Unit.
  
- **Time Tolerance:** The minimum time duration to be considered a single dwell location. Both time and distance are considered.  
  *Type:* Time.

**Derived Output:**
- **Dwell Location Features:** Represents when a track has been stationary given specified time and distance parameters. This output can be in the form of points, convex hulls, or mean centers.  
  *Type:* Feature Set.

**Toolset:** Manage Data

**Tool:** Calculate Field

**Description:**  
The Calculate Field tool in ArcGIS Pro is used to compute the values of a field for a feature class, feature layer, or raster. This tool is essential for performing both simple and complex calculations on field values within a table. It allows users to update many records in a table simultaneously, which is particularly useful in spatial analysis and GIS workflows. For example, you can use this tool to calculate the total cost of damages in a flood scenario by applying a specific formula to a field representing flood depth. The tool supports expressions written in Arcade, Python, SQL, and VBScript, enabling a wide range of calculations from basic arithmetic to more advanced logic-based operations. It is important to note that this tool modifies the input data, so users should ensure they have backups or use the Enable Undo option to prevent data loss.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Layer:** The input features that will have a field calculated.  
  *Type:* Record Set.
  
- **Output Name:** The name of the output feature service.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Field Name:** The name of the field that will have values calculated. This can be an existing field or a new field.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Field Type:** Specifies the field type for the calculated field. Options include String, Integer, Double, and Date.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Expression:** Calculates values in the field. Expressions are written in Arcade and can include operators like [+ - * /].  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Track Aware (Optional):** Specifies whether the expression will use a track-aware expression.  
  *Type:* Boolean.
  
- **Track Fields:** One or more fields that will be used to identify unique tracks.  
  *Type:* Field.
  
- **Data Store (Optional):** Specifies the ArcGIS Data Store where the output will be stored.  
  *Type:* Spatiotemporal big data store.

**Derived Output:**
- **Output Dataset:** A new dataset with calculated fields.  
  *Type:* Feature Class; Table.
