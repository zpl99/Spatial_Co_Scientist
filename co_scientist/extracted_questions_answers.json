So I look like I look younger from my age. I didn't compliment myself, but I felt that, you know, in in the University, in Conference Academia, setting. Everybody always think that I am a Phd. Student rather than professor. and they always like said, because I look young. So when I have a gray hair, I'm so happy like I try to kind of like. can I have like more gray hair, you know, and then I try to deliberately wearing at least blazer or coat that I usually, you know, get it from Tgmex or Ross."

So one thing that anyone who knows me sort of generally like socially, personally, or whatever knows like, I'm a fan of music and so one way that I assert leadership, or I guess, manage leadership like in my classroom is that I play music. So I'm in engineering. There are times where so like before class, there's music playing. Sometimes we'll have, like, I'll give them an assignment where they're supposed to work things out, you know, within a group, or independently, however they choose to do so, and then we'll solve it together, like as a class with me at the board. But I essentially say, all right. You get a song or two songs to try to do this problem. And it's also an open playlist, so that my students have access to that link, and they can add songs that they like to it as well. So that's 1 way that immediately comes to my mind when I think about like how I demonstrate the type of leader I am is one that's authentic to me, but also very collaborative to the people that I'm working with. So yes, yeah, you are my students, but I don't necessarily control the music. I mean, I do because I play it. But the playlist that I play from is literally a compilation of playlists, or, I guess, a compilation of songs over the past 6 years that I've been teaching. So I've added songs to it, but a lot of the songs come from students."

    "回答": [
      {
        "Dr. Christina Campbell": "One way I like to assert my leadership is recognizing if I have privilege and power within the space, and how I can leverage my privilege to benefit things like diversity, social justice. Like, if you don't want a diverse pool, don't put me on the application committee. Don't put me in charge of selecting the core to grad students. If you don't really care about retention, don't want me involved. I also pride myself on being strategic, and I get a lot of joy out of problem solving. So no matter how complicated something is, I try to figure out how we can leverage any strengths or assets or privileges to our benefit and maximize that so we can solve an issue or problem. Anytime I feel like, whether it's education, privilege, or network or resource, and I could use that to leverage support or advancement of myself, my community, the village, students, then I'll do that, even if it's not with a big voice, just in a silent way where people can get the support they need."

Doing the work in the case of, for example, grant application or planning for expo, seminar, or conference. Being the brain is in the case of leading a research project with graduate students and showing them the way. So those two things are additional ways I assert leadership."

For graduate students, I think they see the same thing—a long history of mentoring graduate students, even during my PhD, with multiple undergraduate research assistants, and not only showing the process but also able to show the outcomes, which is publication. The undergraduate research assistants I was working with usually became my second author in the publication."

So, despite me feeling very much not like a leader in certain spaces, I'm still being asked to collaborate on grants or be on advisory board panels and things. While I always agree, sometimes it's just like, 'Oh, wow! Really, like me?' When I think about some other people, or any other person they could potentially call, they call me. Even though it stirs up feelings of being an imposter, in some other ways, it feels very reaffirming that even though I'm struggling in this space or with this identity, there are people who are recognizing the work I'm doing or trying to do, and that can be very validating."

Being mentored in that area will probably allow me to move forward with more confidence in things that I feel like I'm supposed to be doing, but I haven't really moved forward with diligently—I'm moving forward but slowly, with hesitancy. There are areas that I am strategically trying to grow in leadership. One of them has to do with teaching, negotiating, or teaching negotiations. I've been doing it personally and had success and worked with people individually. But I do feel overwhelmed about exploring this professional development sort of path. I don't really have a leadership mentor to, when I'm having questions and concerns or feeling insecure—I don't necessarily have a leadership mentor per se. I have like business mentors and things like that, but someone who specifically thinks about leadership and what that looks like so that I could... I don't know if that's the answer but just maybe."

It very much reminds me of—you should take your own advice. You can give advice to other people, but then, when it comes to you, it's so hard to take it. Her saying that, I'm just like, what do you mean—like you can't take up space? You were attacked for this reason, God chose you for this reason—you wouldn't be here if you weren't meant to be here for that reason. Do I believe that all the time? No, but I should take my own advice. That's how I feel about that statement. We all deserve to be in the spaces that we have entered into, because we wouldn't be here if we weren't supposed to be—but I totally understand this idea of 'me?'"

I feel like we are so much more gracious to white individuals, and especially white men. Because the reality is, they can make mistakes sometimes. And it it's it's true we should be able to make those same mistakes, too. The repercussions seem to be so different. So it can create a strong sense of vulnerability, because there's the same like, it's okay. If they do it, it's a problem if I do it. And I'm mixing up the quote. But it's this idea that we live in a society of double standards. If I do something wrong, it's there's less optimism around what happened. And there's less benefit of the doubt that's given. And so I think it does create a tension of vulnerability."
