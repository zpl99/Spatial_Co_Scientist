 objects, or events based on their spatial or geographic characteristics. It encompasses a wide range of methods and techniques designed to analyze the distribution, patterns, and relationships of elements within a spatial framework, often leveraging probability, geometry, and statistical modeling. Spatial clustering is integral to identifying significant geographic patterns, detecting anomalies, and understanding the spatial proximity or similarity of data points.
 particularly in areas with non-uniform population density. It also aids in detecting patterns of elevated standardized mortality rates (SMR) in urban settings like Dundee and Perth. Moreover, the methods are essential for understanding rare or large clusters as well as the spatial arrangements of cases or events.,,,,,,,
