prompt is You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

Core Concept Definitions:
- Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
- Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
- Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
- Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
- Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
- Amount:
  - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
  - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
- Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

Your Task:

Think step by step. Generate only the next transformation step based on the current path and available concepts.

Output Format (choose one):

Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → [new_id] New concept name  
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. How to build the transformation 

Option B–Use existing concepts without generating a new one  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → (used together) or [id] Existing concept name
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. Why and How to build the transformation 

Option C–Stop generation
STOP

---
Rules (you MUST follow):
1. Use valid core concepts with consistent IDs and names.
2. You may derive a new concept OR reuse concepts already in the list.
3. You MAY use a previously defined concept (even one from the question) as the output of a step — e.g., if the question mentions "least cost route", and you derive how it's computed.
4. If multiple concepts are used without a new concept, use `(used together)` as output.
5. Use unique output IDs for new concepts (no reuse).
6. Do NOT answer the question. Do NOT jump or skip steps.
7. Your goal is to derive target item: network. Once this concept is generated in any step, immediately respond with only: STOP
---
Now, output the next transformation step using exactly one of the formats above.


  
, result is Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (2): [1] Saqsaywaman + [2] Qorikancha + [3] Cusco Cathedral + [4] Mercado Central de San Pedro + [5] Travel time by car → [9] Travel time matrix  
Explanation: A travel time matrix is computed to represent the pairwise travel times by car between all the locations (Saqsaywaman, Qorikancha, Cusco Cathedral, Mercado Central de San Pedro). This matrix will be used to evaluate the optimized order of visits.
prompt is You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

Core Concept Definitions:
- Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
- Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
- Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
- Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
- Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
- Amount:
  - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
  - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
- Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

Your Task:

Think step by step. Generate only the next transformation step based on the current path and available concepts.

Output Format (choose one):

Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → [new_id] New concept name  
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. How to build the transformation 

Option B–Use existing concepts without generating a new one  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → (used together) or [id] Existing concept name
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. Why and How to build the transformation 

Option C–Stop generation
STOP

---
Rules (you MUST follow):
1. Use valid core concepts with consistent IDs and names.
2. You may derive a new concept OR reuse concepts already in the list.
3. You MAY use a previously defined concept (even one from the question) as the output of a step — e.g., if the question mentions "least cost route", and you derive how it's computed.
4. If multiple concepts are used without a new concept, use `(used together)` as output.
5. Use unique output IDs for new concepts (no reuse).
6. Do NOT answer the question. Do NOT jump or skip steps.
7. Your goal is to derive target item: network. Once this concept is generated in any step, immediately respond with only: STOP
---
Now, output the next transformation step using exactly one of the formats above.

step id (1): [1] Saqsaywaman + [2] Qorikancha + [3] Cusco Cathedral + [4] Mercado Central de San Pedro + [5] Travel time by car → [9] Travel time matrix  
Explanation: A travel time matrix is computed to represent the pairwise travel times by car between all the locations (Saqsaywaman, Qorikancha, Cusco Cathedral, Mercado Central de San Pedro). This matrix will be used to evaluate the optimized order of visits.
prompt is You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

Core Concept Definitions:
- Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
- Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
- Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
- Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
- Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
- Amount:
  - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
  - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
- Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

Question:
I am currently staying at Hostel El Grial in Cusco, Peru. I want to visit Sacsayhuamán for 1.5 hours, Qorikancha Temple for 1 hour, the Cusco Cathedral for 1.5 hours, and the Mercado Central de San Pedro for 1 hour. I have 6 hours available. I will leave my hostel at 8 am. Give the most optimized order to visit these places. I will drive my car.

Options:
1. Saqsaywaman -> Cusco Cathedral -> Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Qorikancha (35 mins)
2. Cusco Cathedral -> Qorikancha -> Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Saqsaywaman (37 mins)
3. Saqsaywaman -> Qorikancha -> Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Visit Cusco Cathedral (48 mins)
4. Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Qorikancha -> Cusco Cathedral -> Saqsaywaman (33 mins)


Current identified core concepts:
- [0] Hostal El Grial: location  
- [1] Saqsaywaman: object  
- [2] Qorikancha: object  
- [3] Cusco Cathedral: object  
- [4] Mercado Central de San Pedro: object  
- [5] Travel time by car: field  
- [6] Visit duration: content amount  
- [7] Optimized order of visits: network  

- [7] target item: network  

Transformation path built so far:

['Option A–Generate a new concept  \nstep id (1): [1] Saqsaywaman + [2] Qorikancha + [3] Cusco Cathedral + [4] Mercado Central de San Pedro + [5] Travel time by car → [8] Travel time matrix  \nExplanation: A travel time matrix is computed to represent the pairwise travel times by car between all the locations (Saqsaywaman, Qorikancha, Cusco Cathedral, Mercado Central de San Pedro). This matrix will help in determining the optimized order of visits.', 'Option A–Generate a new concept  \nstep id (2): [8] Travel time matrix + [6] Visit duration → [9] Time allocation matrix  \nExplanation: A time allocation matrix is computed by combining the travel time matrix with the visit durations for each location. This matrix represents the total time required for traveling and visiting each location, which is essential for determining the optimized order of visits.']


Your Task:

Think step by step. Generate only the next transformation step based on the current path and available concepts.

Output Format (choose one):

Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → [new_id] New concept name  
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. How to build the transformation 

Option B–Use existing concepts without generating a new one  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → (used together) or [id] Existing concept name
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. Why and How to build the transformation 

Option C–Stop generation
STOP

---
Rules (you MUST follow):
1. Use valid core concepts with consistent IDs and names.
2. You may derive a new concept OR reuse concepts already in the list.
3. You MAY use a previously defined concept (even one from the question) as the output of a step — e.g., if the question mentions "least cost route", and you derive how it's computed.
4. If multiple concepts are used without a new concept, use `(used together)` as output.
5. Use unique output IDs for new concepts (no reuse).
6. Do NOT answer the question. Do NOT jump or skip steps.
7. Your goal is to derive target item: network. Once this concept is generated in any step, immediately respond with only: STOP
---
Now, output the next transformation step using exactly one of the formats above.


  
, result is Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (3): [9] Time allocation matrix → [10] Feasible visit sequences  
Explanation: Using the time allocation matrix, feasible visit sequences are derived by identifying all possible orders of visits that fit within the 6-hour time constraint (including travel and visit durations). This step ensures that only valid sequences are considered for optimization.
prompt is You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

Core Concept Definitions:
- Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
- Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
- Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
- Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
- Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
- Amount:
  - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
  - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
- Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

Example 1:
Q: What is the least cost route from school to the closest road intersection based on slope and land use in Utrecht?
Concepts:
  - [0] school: object
  - [1] road intersection: object
  - [2] slope: field
  - [3] land use: field
  - [4] least cost route: field
  - [5] cost surface: field
Extent:
  - Utrecht
Transformations:
  1. [2] + [3] → [5] cost surface
  2. [0] + [1] + [5] → [4] least cost route

Example 2:
Q: What is the number of Asian people within 1.5 miles of library branches in Palm City?
Concepts:
  - [0] library branches: object
  - [1] distance field (1.5 mi): field
  - [2] Asian people: object
  - [3] number of people: content amount
Extent:
  - Palm City
Transformations:
  1. [0] → [1]

Question:
I am currently staying at Hostel El Grial in Cusco, Peru. I want to visit Sacsayhuamán for 1.5 hours, Qorikancha Temple for 1 hour, the Cusco Cathedral for 1.5 hours, and the Mercado Central de San Pedro for 1 hour. I have 6 hours available. I will leave my hostel at 8 am. Give the most optimized order to visit these places. I will drive my car.

Options:
1. Saqsaywaman -> Cusco Cathedral -> Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Qorikancha (35 mins)
2. Cusco Cathedral -> Qorikancha -> Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Saqsaywaman (37 mins)
3. Saqsaywaman -> Qorikancha -> Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Visit Cusco Cathedral (48 mins)
4. Mercado Central de San Pedro -> Qorikancha -> Cusco Cathedral -> Saqsaywaman (33 mins)


Current identified core concepts:
- [0] Hostal El Grial: location  
- [1] Saqsaywaman: object  
- [2] Qorikancha: object  
- [3] Cusco Cathedral: object  
- [4] Mercado Central de San Pedro: object  
- [5] Travel time by car: field  
- [6] Visit duration: content amount  
- [7] Optimized order: network  

- [7] target item: network  

Transformation path built so far:

['Option A–Generate a new concept  \nstep id (1): [1] Saqsaywaman + [2] Qorikancha + [3] Cusco Cathedral + [4] Mercado Central de San Pedro + [5] Travel time by car → [8] Travel time matrix  \nExplanation: A travel time matrix is computed to represent the pairwise travel times by car between all the locations (Saqsaywaman, Qorikancha, Cusco Cathedral, Mercado Central de San Pedro) and the starting point (Hostal El Grial). This matrix will serve as the foundation for optimizing the order of visits.', 'Option A–Generate a new concept  \nstep id (2): [8] Travel time matrix + [6] Visit duration → [9] Time allocation matrix  \nExplanation: A time allocation matrix is computed by combining the travel time matrix with the visit durations for each location. This matrix represents the total time required for traveling to and visiting each location, which will be used to optimize the order of visits.  ']


Your Task:

Think step by step. Generate only the next transformation step based on the current path and available concepts.

Output Format (choose one):

Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → [new_id] New concept name  
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. How to build the transformation 

Option B–Use existing concepts without generating a new one  
step id (1,2,3...): [id] Concept A + [id] Concept B [+ ...] → (used together) or [id] Existing concept name
Explanation: Describe what is computed or derived. Why and How to build the transformation 

Option C–Stop generation
STOP

---
Rules (you MUST follow):
1. Use valid core concepts with consistent IDs and names.
2. You may derive a new concept OR reuse concepts already in the list.
3. You MAY use a previously defined concept (even one from the question) as the output of a step — e.g., if the question mentions "least cost route", and you derive how it's computed.
4. If multiple concepts are used without a new concept, use `(used together)` as output.
5. Use unique output IDs for new concepts (no reuse).
6. Do NOT answer the question. Do NOT jump or skip steps.
7. Your goal is to derive target item: network. Once this concept is generated in any step, immediately respond with only: STOP
---
Now, output the next transformation step using exactly one of the formats above.


  
, result is Option A–Generate a new concept  
step id (3): [9] Time allocation matrix → [10] Feasible visit sequences  
Explanation: Using the time allocation matrix, feasible visit sequences are generated by identifying all possible orders of visiting the locations (Saqsaywaman, Qorikancha, Cusco Cathedral, Mercado Central de San Pedro) within the given time constraint of 6 hours. This step ensures that only valid sequences that fit the time limit are considered for optimization.
prompt is You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

Core Concept Definitions:
- Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
- Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
- Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
- Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
- Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
- Amount:
  - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
  - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
- Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

Example 1:
Q: What is the least cost route from school to the closest road intersection based on slope and land use in Utrecht?
Concepts:
  - [0] school: object
  - [1] road intersection: object
  - [2] slope: field
  - [3] land use: field
  - [4] least cost route: field
  - [5] cost surface: field
Extent:
  - Utrecht
Transformations:
  1. [2] + [3] → [5] cost surface
  2. [0] + [1] + [5] → [4] least cost route

Rules (you MUST follow):
1. Use valid core concepts with consistent IDs and names.
2. You may derive a new concept OR reuse concepts already in the list.
3. You MAY use a previously defined concept (even one from the question) as the output of a step — e.g., if the question mentions "least cost route", and you derive how it's computed.
4. If multiple concepts are used without a new concept, use `(used together)` as output.
5. Use unique output IDs for new concepts (no reuse).
6. Do NOT answer the question. Do NOT jump or skip steps.
7. Your goal is to derive target item: network. Once this concept is generated in any step, immediately respond with only: STOP

prompt is You are a spatial reasoning agent helping construct a transformation path step by step for answering a geographic question.

Each step builds on previous ones, using spatial core concepts and their relations. DO NOT skip steps or output the final answer. You must output only one transformation step at a time.

Core Concept Definitions:
- Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
- Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
- Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
- Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
- Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
- Amount:
  - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
  - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
- Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

Example 1:
Q: What is the least cost route from school to the closest road intersection based on slope and land use in Utrecht?
Concepts:
  - [0] school: object
  - [1] road intersection: object
  - [2] slope: field
  - [3] land use: field
  - [4] least cost route: field
  - [5] cost surface: field
Extent:
  - Utrecht
Transformations:
  1. [2] + [3] → [5] cost surface
  2. [0] + [1] + [5] → [4] least cost route

Example 2:
Q: What is the number of Asian people within 1.5 miles of library branches in Palm City?
Concepts:
  - [0] library branches: object
  - [1] distance field (1.5 mi): field
  - [2] Asian people: object
  - [3] number of people: content amount
Extent:
  - Palm City
Transformations:
  1. [0] → [1]
  2. [2] + [1] → [3]
