- Updated Features: Contains the new or updated record information from the input table. Type: Feature Layer.
Toolset: Find Locations

Tool: Find Similar Locations

Description: Identifies the candidate features that are most similar or dissimilar to one or more input features based on feature attributes. This tool is used to find areas that meet specified criteria, which can be based on attribute queries or spatial queries. For example, it can be used to identify areas within a certain distance of a river or parcels that are vacant.

Parameters:
- Input Features: The features to compare against. Type: Feature Layer.
- Candidate Features: The features to compare with the input features. Type: Feature Layer.
- Output Features: The resulting features that are most similar or dissimilar. Type: Feature Layer.

Derived Output:
- Similarity Index: A value indicating the degree of similarity between features. Type: Double.
- Dissimilarity Index: A value indicating the degree of dissimilarity between features. Type: Double.
Toolset: Find Locations

Tool: Find Dwell Locations

Description: Finds locations where moving objects have stopped, or dwelled, using given time and distance thresholds. This tool is designed to identify areas that meet specified criteria based on spatial and attribute queries. For example, it can be used to find locations where vehicles have stopped for a certain duration within a specific distance range. It is commonly used in spatial analysis workflows to analyze patterns of movement and identify significant stopping points in a transportation network.

Parameters:
- Time Threshold: Specifies the minimum time threshold for a location to be considered a dwell location. Type: Double.
- Distance Threshold: Specifies the maximum distance within which a location is considered to have dwelled. Type: Double.

Derived Output:
- Dwell Locations: A feature layer containing the identified dwell locations. Type: Feature Layer.
**Toolset:** Summarize Center And Dispersion

**Tool:** Summarize Center And Dispersion

**Description:**
The "Summarize Center And Dispersion" tool finds central features and directional distributions, calculating mean and median locations from the input data. It is commonly used in spatial analysis to understand the central tendency and dispersion of geographic features. For instance, it can identify the central point of a cluster of crime incidents or determine the average location of customer addresses for a retail store. This tool aids in spatial granularity analysis by providing insights into the spatial distribution and central tendencies of data points.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Features**: The features for which central tendencies and dispersion will be calculated. Type: Feature Layer.
- **Weight Field**: A field used to weight the calculation of central tendencies. Type: Field.
- **Case Field**: A field used to group features for separate calculations. Type: Field.

**Derived Output:**
- **Mean Center**: The calculated mean center of the input features. Type: Feature Class.
- **Median Center**: The calculated median center of the input features. Type: Feature Class.
- **Standard Distance**: The calculated standard distance of the input features. Type: Feature Class.
