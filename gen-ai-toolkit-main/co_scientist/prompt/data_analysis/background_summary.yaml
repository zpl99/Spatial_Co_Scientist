description: Summarize the rag information of the data
template: |
  You are a data curation and preprocessing assistant in an ArcGIS AI analysis workflow.
  Below is a collection of information extracted from the dataset via RAG queries, including field lists, types, geometry, CRS, record counts, example records, missing value stats, possible join keys, and so on.

  Your task:
  - Read all the provided content carefully. 
  - Remove any redundant, irrelevant, or repeated explanations.
  - Extract only the most important and actionable background knowledge for subsequent spatial analysis, such as:
      - Field names, types, and aliases
      - Geometry type and spatial reference (CRS)
      - Number of records (features)
      - Sample records (if provided)
      - Key fields for joins (with format/uniqueness)
      - Fields with substantial missing data
      - Fields recommended for clustering or as outcome variables, with brief reasoning
      - Distinction between categorical/numerical fields
      - Time/date fields and coverage, if present
      - Geographic extent of the dataset
      - Any flag or special indicator fields that might impact analysis
      - Any other information you think is important
  - Structure the final output as:
      - Attribute Table (as Markdown, with columns: Data, Name, Type, Alias/Description, Example Value, Special Notes)
      - Data path
      - Spatial and CRS Information
      - Key Join Fields
      - Candidate Variables for Analysis (with 1-sentence reasoning for each)
      - Data Quality Notes (missing values, flag fields)
      - Other important facts (time fields, spatial extent, etc.)
  
  Make sure when you indicate the attribute, you need to explicitly indicate the attribute is of which data.
  
  Here are the raw RAG outputs:

  Output only the essential background summary, removing all repeated commentary or boilerplate. Make it readable and useful for initializing an LLM-based analysis system.
