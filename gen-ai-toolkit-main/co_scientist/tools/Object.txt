**Toolset:** Find Locations

**Tool:** Find Dwell Locations

**Description:**  
The Find Dwell Locations tool is designed to identify locations where moving objects have stopped or dwelled, using specified time and distance thresholds. This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where tracking the stationary periods of objects is necessary, such as monitoring vehicle stops, animal resting points, or any other application requiring the detection of idle periods. For example, a city might use this tool to analyze the dwell locations of snow plow trucks to optimize routes or identify areas needing more frequent service. The tool works by analyzing time-enabled point features that represent instants in time, defining dwell locations as sequential observations with minimal movement over a specified period.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Features:** The point tracks in which dwells will be found. The input must be a time-enabled layer with features that represent instants in time.  
  *Type:* Feature Set.

- **Distance Method:** Specifies how the distances between dwell features will be calculated. Options include Geodesic and Planar.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **Distance Tolerance:** The maximum distance between points to be considered a single dwell location.  
  *Type:* Linear Unit.
  
- **Time Tolerance:** The minimum time duration to be considered a single dwell location. Both time and distance are considered.  
  *Type:* Time Unit.

**Derived Output:**
- **Dwell Location Features:** Represents dwell features as either points, convex hulls, or mean centers, indicating where tracks have been stationary given specified time and distance parameters.  
  *Type:* Feature Set.

**Tool: Find Similar Locations**

**Description:**  
The "Find Similar Locations" tool in ArcGIS Pro is designed to identify candidate features that are most similar or dissimilar to one or more input features based on their attributes. This tool is particularly useful in spatial analysis and GIS workflows where identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in large datasets is necessary. For example, it can be used to find stores that are most similar to a top-performing store based on attributes such as "SickDays," "TotalCustomers," and "AvgPurchaseAmount." This tool is part of the GeoAnalytics Desktop tools, which utilize a parallel processing framework for efficient analysis of big data on a desktop machine using Apache Spark.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Layer**: The reference layer (or a selection on a layer) containing the features to be compared.  
  Type: Record Set.
  
- **Search Layer**: The candidate layer (or a selection on a layer) containing candidate-matching features. The tool searches for features most similar (or dissimilar) to the Input Layer parameter among these candidates. Type: Record Set.
  
- **Output Name**: The name of the output feature class that will contain a record for each of the Input Layer parameters and the most similar or dissimilar candidate features. Type: String.

- **Analysis Fields**: The fields used to determine similarity. These fields are used to calculate the similarity or dissimilarity between the reference and candidate features. Type: Field.

- **Most Or Least Similar**: Specifies whether to find the most similar or least similar features. Type: String.

- **Match Method**: Specifies the method used to determine similarity or dissimilarity. Options include "ATTRIBUTE_VALUES" and "ATTRIBUTE_PROFILES." Type: String.

**Tool:** Clip Layer

**Description:**  
The Clip Layer tool in ArcGIS Pro is designed to extract input features that fall within specified polygon boundaries. It is commonly used to create a geographic subset of features from a larger feature class, often referred to as a study area or area of interest (AOI). This tool acts like a cookie cutter, clipping point, line, or polygon features using one or more features from another feature class. The output will contain the input layer features that overlay the clip layer polygons, maintaining the same geometry type as the input features. For example, clipping line features within a polygon will result in line outputs. This tool is particularly useful in spatial analysis workflows where defining a specific area of interest is necessary, such as environmental studies, urban planning, or resource management.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Layer:** The dataset containing the point, line, or polygon features to be clipped.  
  *Type:* Feature Layer
- **Clip Layer:** The dataset containing the polygon features used to clip the input features.  
  *Type:* Feature Layer
- **Output Feature Class:** The output feature class with clipped features.  
  *Type:* Feature Class

**Derived Output:**
- **Output Feature Class:** The clipped output containing features from the input layer that overlay the clip layer polygons.  
  *Type:* Feature Class

The tool is powered by ArcGIS GeoAnalytics Server, which performs the analysis on the server and stores results in ArcGIS Enterprise. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use data local to the GeoAnalytics Server and set the extent environment to focus on data of interest.
