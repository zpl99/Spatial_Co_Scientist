For example, it can be used to assess how new buildings will affect sunlight exposure on existing structures or public spaces. The tool generates multipatch feature classes that represent these shadow volumes, providing a visual and analytical representation of shadow impacts in 3D space.

- **Base Elevation:** This parameter is ignored. Type: Numeric.
- **Project to Plane:** This parameter is ignored. Type: Boolean.

**Derived Output:**
- **Output Multipatch Feature Class:** Contains the shadow volumes as closed multipatch features. Type: Feature Class.
  - **OID:** The FID of the multipatch.
  - **Shape:** The multipatch shape.
  - **OBSV_PT_ID:** The FID of the observer point used to create the skyline.
  - **ORIGFTR_ID:** The FID of the original feature represented by the skyline segment or silhouette.
  - **SILHOUE_ID:** The FID of the multipatch feature used to create the shadow volume.

**Tool:** Locate Outliers

**Description:**  
The Locate Outliers tool is designed to identify anomalous elevation measurements from terrain, TIN, or LAS datasets. It detects points that exceed a defined range of elevation values or have slope characteristics inconsistent with the surrounding surface. This tool is particularly useful for locating suspicious measurement points that may be erroneous. The identified outliers are written as points to an output feature class, allowing analysts to verify each point individually. Verified blunders can be used as input to the Delete Terrain Points tool. Typical use cases include quality control in elevation data processing, ensuring the accuracy of terrain models, and identifying potential errors in elevation datasets.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Surface:** The surface dataset (TIN or terrain) to be analyzed. Type: Surface Layer.
- **Apply Hard Limit:** Option to locate measurements with z-values outside specified minimum and maximum limits. Type: Boolean.
- **Apply Comparison Filter:** Option to locate measurements that exceed a height difference relative to their neighbors and create local surface patches with slopes exceeding a given threshold. Type: Boolean.
- **Z Tolerance (Optional):** Compares z-values of neighboring points if the comparison filter is applied. Default is 0. Type: Double.
- **Slope Tolerance (Optional):** The threshold of slope variance between consecutive points used to identify outlier points. Default is 150%. Type: Double.
- **Exceed Tolerance Ratio (Optional):** Defines criteria for determining each outlier point based on the ratio of points in its natural neighborhood that must exceed specified comparison filters. Default is 0.5. Type: Double.
- **Outlier Cap (Optional):** Maximum number of outlier points that can be written to the output. Default is 2,500. Type: Long.

**Derived Output:**
- **Output Feature Class:** The feature class containing the identified outlier points. Type: Feature Class.

**Tool:** Surface Aspect

**Description:**  
The Surface Aspect tool is used to create polygon features that represent aspect measurements derived from a TIN, terrain, or LAS dataset surface. Aspect is expressed in degrees and represents the horizontal orientation of a surface. This tool is particularly useful in spatial analysis for applications such as identifying areas with specific sun exposure, which can be critical for agricultural planning, solar panel placement, or understanding geomorphological processes. For example, a farmer might use this tool to locate fields with a southerly aspect to maximize sunlight exposure.

**Parameters:**
- **in_surface:** The TIN, terrain, or LAS dataset surface that will be processed.  
  *Type:* LAS Dataset Layer; Terrain Layer; TIN Layer.
  
- **out_feature_class:** The feature class that will be produced.  
  *Type:* Feature Class.
  
- **class_breaks_table (Optional):** A table containing the classification breaks that will be used to define the aspect ranges in the output feature class.  
  *Type:* Table.
  
- **aspect_field (Optional):** The field containing aspect code values.  
  *Type:* String.
  
- **pyramid_level_resolution (Optional):** The z-tolerance or window-size resolution of the terrain pyramid level that will be used. The default is 0, or full resolution.  
  *Type:* Double.

**Derived Output:**
- **out_feature_class:** The output polygon feature class representing aspect measurements.  
  *Type:* Feature Class.

**Tool: Surface Contour**

**Description:**  
The Surface Contour tool in ArcGIS Pro is designed to create contour lines from a terrain, TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network), or LAS dataset surface. The output is a 2D polyline feature class where contour heights are assigned as attributes. This tool is particularly useful in spatial analysis and GIS workflows for visualizing elevation changes across a surface. It is commonly used in engineering to produce precise contour lines that represent an exact linear interpretation of the surface model. However, these contours are not typically used for aesthetic cartographic outputs due to their lack of smoothness. For smoother contours, it is recommended to convert the terrain dataset to a raster or TIN using the Terrain To Raster or TIN To Raster tools, followed by the Raster Contour tool with the Natural Neighbors interpolant. The tool is available with the 3D Analyst license.

**Parameters:**
- **Input Surface:** The TIN, terrain, or LAS dataset surface to be processed.  
  *Type: LAS Dataset Layer; Terrain Layer; TIN Layer.*
  
- **Contour Interval:** The interval between the contours.  
  *Type: Double.*

- **Base Contour (Optional):** Defines the starting Z value from which the contour interval is either added or subtracted to delineate contours.  
  *Type: Double.*

- **Z Factor (Optional):** Affects results for rasters and TINs, not terrain datasets.  
  *Type: Double.*

- **Contour Field (Optional):** The field in the output feature class that will store contour values.  
  *Type: String.*

- **Contour Field Precision (Optional):** Specifies the precision of the contour field. Zero indicates an integer, and numbers 1–9 indicate the number of decimal places.  
  *Type: Integer.*

- **Index Interval (Optional):** Used to differentiate index contours from regular contours, typically five times larger than the contour interval.  
  *Type: Double.*

- **Index Interval Field (Optional):** The name of the field used to identify index contours.  
  *Type: String.*

**Derived Output:**
- **Output Feature Class:** The feature class that will be produced, containing the contour lines.
