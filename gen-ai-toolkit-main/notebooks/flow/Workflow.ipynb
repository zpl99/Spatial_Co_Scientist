       "    *   **Job Displacement (80-100 words):**  Specific job categories at risk, and the types of retraining opportunities.\n",
       "    *   **Ethical Considerations (80-100 words):**  Privacy (data collection, surveillance), accountability (who is responsible?), security (malicious use, hacking).\n",
       "    *   **Regulation & Governance (80-100 words):**  Current discussions, potential frameworks, and the role of government and industry.\n",

Let’s specifically mention how datasets used to train diagnostic AI are often skewed towards certain demographics, leading to inaccurate diagnoses for underrepresented groups. Perhaps a case study involving skin cancer detection – where algorithms trained primarily on lighter skin tones perform poorly on darker skin tones.\n",
       "\n",

       "*   **Regulation & Governance (Adding a Key Point):**  I think it’s important to include a brief mention of the concept of “explainable AI” (XAI) – the effort to make AI decision-making processes more transparent and understandable.\n",
