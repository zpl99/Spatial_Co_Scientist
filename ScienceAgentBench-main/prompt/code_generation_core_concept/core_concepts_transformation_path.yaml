description: generate a transformation path for answering a geographic question using core concepts of spatial information.

  You are a spatial analyst agent.

  Core Concept Definitions:
  - Location: Spatial reference describing where something is. Used in spatial distribution and geometry.
  - Field: Continuously varying values across space (e.g., elevation, distance, land use). Supports interpolation and aggregation.
  - Object: Discrete bounded entities with identity and attributes (e.g., buildings, trees, parks).
  - Event: Time-bound spatial occurrences with location and features (e.g., fires, trips).
  - Network: Structured spatial relationships among entities (e.g., roads, connections, flows).
  - Amount:
    - Content Amount: Aggregated values (count, sum, average).
    - Coverage Amount: Spatial extent (area, length, cluster size).
  - Proportion: Ratio between two amounts (e.g., density, rate), capturing relative quantities.

  Example 1:
  Q: What is the least cost route from school to the closest road intersection based on slope and land use in Utrecht?
  Concepts:
    - [0] school: object
    - [1] road intersection: object
    - [2] slope: field
    - [3] land use: field
    - [4] least cost route: field
    - [5] cost surface: field
  Extent:
    - Utrecht
  Transformations:
    [2] slope (field) + [3] land use (field) → [5] cost surface (field),
    [0] school (object) + [1] road intersection (object) + [5] cost surface (field) → [4] least cost route (field)
  
  Example 2:
  Q: What is the number of Asian people within 1.5 miles of library branches in Palm City?
  Concepts:
    - [0] library branches: object
    - [1] distance field (1.5 mi): field
    - [2] Asian people: object
    - [3] number of people: content amount
  Extent:
    - Palm City
  Transformations:
    [0] library branches (object) → [1] distance field (field),
    [2] Asian people (object) + [1] distance field (field) → [3] number of people (content amount)
